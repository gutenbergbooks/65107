  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> The House</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>There are two sides from which you may first
profitably look at the house. One is from the
park, the north side. From here the pile shows
best the vastness of its size; it looks like a mediaeval
village. It is heaped with no attempt at symmetry; it
is sombre and frowning; the grey towers rise; the
battlements cut out their square regularity against the
sky; the buttresses of the old twelfth-century tithe-barn
give a rough impression of fortifications. There
is a line of trees in one of the inner courtyards, and
their green heads show above the roofs of the old
breweries; but although they are actually trees of a
considerable size they are dwarfed and unnoticeable
against the mass of the buildings blocked behind them.
The whole pile soars to a peak which is the clocktower
with its pointed roof: it might be the spire of
the church on the summit of the hill crowning the
mediaeval village. At sunset I have seen the silhouette
of the great building stand dead black on a red sky; on
moonlight nights it stands black and silent, with glinting
windows, like an enchanted castle. On misty autumn
nights I have seen it emerging partially from the trails
of vapour, and heard the lonely roar of the red deer
roaming under the walls.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c017'>The other side is the garden side—the gay, princely
side, with flowers in the foreground; the grey walls
rising straight up from the green turf; the mullioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>windows, and the Tudor gables with the heraldic
leopards sitting stiffly at each corner. The park side is
the side for winter; the garden side the side for
summer. It has an indescribable gaiety and courtliness.
The grey of the Kentish rag is almost pearly in the sun,
the occasional coral festoon of a climbing rose dashed
against it; the long brown-red roofs are broken by the
chimney-stacks with their slim, peaceful threads of blue
smoke mounting steadily upwards. One looks down
upon the house from a certain corner in the garden.
Here is a bench among a group of yews—dark, red-berried
yews; and the house lies below one in the
hollow, lovely in its colour and its serenity. It has all
the quality of peace and permanence; of mellow age;
of stateliness and tradition. It is gentle and venerable.
Yet it is, as I have said, gay. It has the deep inward
gaiety of some very old woman who has always been
beautiful, who has had many lovers and seen many
generations come and go, smiled wisely over their
sorrows and their joys, and learnt an imperishable
secret of tolerance and humour. It is, above all, an
English house. It has the tone of England; it melts
into the green of the garden turf, into the tawnier green
of the park beyond, into the blue of the pale English
sky; it settles down into its hollow amongst the
cushioned tops of the trees; the brown-red of those
roofs is the brown-red of the roofs of humble farms and
pointed oast-houses, such as stain over a wide landscape
of England the quilt-like pattern of the fields. I make
bold to say that it stoops to nothing either pretentious
or meretricious. There is here no flourish of architecture,
no ornament but the leopards, rigid and
vigilant. The stranger may even think, upon arrival,
that the front of the house is disappointing. It is,
indeed, extremely modest. There is a gate-house
flanked by two square grey towers, placed between
two wings which provide only a monotony of windows
and gables. It is true that two or three fine sycamores,
symmetrical and circular as open umbrellas, redeem
the severity of the front, and that a herd of fallow deer,
browsing in the dappled shade of the trees, maintains
the tradition of an English park. But, for the rest, the
front of the house is so severe as to be positively uninteresting;
it is quiet and monkish; “a beautiful decent
simplicity,” said Horace Walpole, “which charms
one.” There is here to be found none of the splendour
of Elizabethan building. A different impression, however,
is in store when once the wicket-gate has been
opened. You are in a courtyard of a size the frontage
had never led you to expect, and the vista through a
second gateway shows you the columns of a second
court; your eye is caught by an oriel window opposite,
and by other windows with heraldic bearings in their
panes, promise of rooms and galleries; by gables and
the heraldic leopards; by the clock tower which gives
an oddly Chinese effect immediately above the Tudor
oriel. Up till a few years ago Virginia creeper blazed
scarlet in autumn on the walls of the Green Court, but
it has now been torn away, and what may be lost in
colour is compensated by the gain in seeing the grey
stone and the slight moulding which runs, following
the shape of the towers, across the house.</p>

<p>NORTH-EAST VIEW OF KNOLE<br /><br /><em>From the drawing by</em> <span class='sc'>T. Bridgeman</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>On the whole, the quadrangle is reminiscent of
Oxford, though more palatial and less studious. The
house is built round a system of these courtyards:
first this one, the Green Court, which is the largest and
most magnificent; then the second one, or Stone
Court, which is not turfed, like the Green Court, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>wholly paved, and which has along one side of it a
Jacobean colonnade; the third court is the Water
Court, and has none of the display of the first two: it
is smaller, and quite demure, indeed rather like some
old house in Nuremberg, with the latticed window
of one of the galleries running the whole length
of it, and the friendly unconcern of an immense
bay-tree growing against one of its walls. There
are four other courts, making seven in all. This
number is supposed to correspond to the days in
the week; and in pursuance of this conceit there are
in the house fifty-two staircases, corresponding to the
weeks in the year, and three hundred and sixty-five
rooms, corresponding to the days. I cannot truthfully
pretend that I have ever verified these counts, and it
may be that their accuracy is accepted solely on the
strength of the legend; but, if this is so, then it has been
a very persistent legend, and I prefer to sympathise
with the amusement of the ultimate architect on
making the discovery that by a judicious juggling with
his additions he could bring courts, stairs, and rooms
up to that satisfactory total.</p>

<p class='c018'>A stone lobby under the oriel window divides the
Green Court from the Stone Court. In summer the
great oak doors of this second gate-house are left open,
and it has sometimes happened that I have found a stag
in the banqueting hall, puzzled but still dignified,
strayed in from the park since no barrier checked him.</p>

<p class='c018'>It becomes impossible, after passing through the
formality of the two first quadrangles, to follow the
ramblings of the house geographically. They are so involved
that, after a lifetime of familiarity, I still catch myself
pausing to think out the shortest route from one room
to another. Four acres of building is no mean matter.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Into the very early mediaeval history of the house I
do not think that I need enter. It is suggested that a
Roman building once occupied the site, and that
some foundations which were recently unearthed
beneath the larder—evidently one of the oldest portions—once
formed part of that construction. The
question of dating the existing buildings, however, is
quite sufficiently complicated without going back to a
building which no longer exists. Nor do I think that
the early owners—the Pembrokes, or the Say and
Seles—offer the smallest interest; if we knew precisely
what parts of the house we owed to them
severally it would be another matter, but the mediaeval
records are very scanty. It is safe to say, generally
speaking, that the north side is the oldest side; it is
the most sombre, the most massive, and the most
irregular; there are buttresses, battlements, and
towers, but no gables and no embellishments—nothing
but solid masonry. Up in the north-east corner is the
old kitchen, and the old entrances through dark archways
at the top of stairways. The passages here, of
thick stone, twist oddly, and their ceilings are groined
by semi-arches which have become lost and embedded
in the alterations to the stone-work. It is a dark, massive,
little-visited corner, this nucleus of Knole.</p>

<p class='c018'>The house, or such portions of it as then existed, was
bought from William, Lord Say and Sele, by
Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, on June 30,
1456, and it is clear from the numerous bills among
the archives at Lambeth Palace that both he and his
more notable successor, Cardinal Morton, carried out
extensive additions, alterations, and repairs. It is, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a very difficult task to determine what parts of the
building definitely belong to this period, for, what with
the additions of the archbishops and the alterations of
the later Sackvilles, all is confusion. It would appear,
for instance, that upon a foundation of Tudor masonry
the Sackvilles constructed the Elizabethan gables
which are now so characteristic a feature of the house;
but it is less easy to say exactly how much the first
Tudor archbishop found there on his arrival of
earlier workmanship. A further confusing factor is the
great fire which took place in 1623, and is reported to
have destroyed a large part of the building—but
exactly where, and how much, we cannot say. Nor are
the accounts at Lambeth very illuminating:</p>

<p class='c019'>In divers costs and expenses made this year [1467] for
repairing the manor of Knole, carriage for the two cart loads
of lathes from Panters to the manor, 14<em>d.</em> For carriage of
thirty loads of stone for the new tower, 7<em>d.</em> load = 16/9.
Carriage of six loads of timber at 7<em>d.</em> = 3/6. Carriage of one
fother of lead from London to Knole, 3/4.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next year, 1468:</p>

<p class='c019'>Repairs at Knole. One labourer for 6 days work in the
great chamber and the new <em>seler</em>, 2/-. Making of 700
lathes to the new tower, 14<em>d.</em> One labourer 4½ days in the
old kitchen, 4<em>d.</em> Item, for 1 j M<sup>1</sup> of walle prygge (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) to the
stable and other places, 13<em>d.</em> One cowl to the masonry, 12<em>d.</em></p>

<p>THE GREEN COURT: BOURCHIER’S ORIEL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The “great chamber” referred to here was in all
probability the present Great Hall, which we know to
have been built by Bourchier about 1460, although it
was altered by Thomas Sackville, who put in the present
ceiling, panelling, and oak screen. Thomas also built
the Great Staircase in 1604–8, leading to the Ball-room,
which is of the time of Bourchier. I expect this
is the “seler” referred to, meaning solar and not
cellar, as might be thought; or did it mean the present
colonnade, which is also of Bourchier’s building, in
1468? The position of the “new tower” is nowhere
specified, but I wonder whether it is not the tower
beside the chapel, where there is a stone fireplace bearing
Bourchier’s cognisance—the double knot—and the
same device in a small pane of stained glass in the window.
This tower, moreover, goes commonly by the
name of Bourchier’s Tower.</p>

<p class='c018'>There are a few more items mentioned in the
Lambeth papers, 1468–9: “Repairs at Knole. Repairs
at one house set aside for the slaughter of sheep
and other [animals?] for the use of the Lord’s great
house at Sevenoaks, 113<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>” This, I think, is certainly
the old slaughter-house which forms one side of
the Queen’s Court. It is obviously a very old building.
But there is one point in this account which is of
interest, namely, that Knole should at this date have
been referred to as the “great house.” This would
seem to prove that the greater mass of the building was
already in existence, since by the latter half of the
fifteenth century there were already many houses and
palaces in England whose bulk would argue that the
current standard of greatness might be high and the
adjective not too readily applied. The Primate owned,
moreover, up to the time of the Reformation no less
than twelve palaces and houses of residence in the
diocese of Canterbury alone, namely, Bekesburn, Ford,
Maidstone, Charing, Saltwood, Aldington, Wingham,
Wrotham, Tenterden, Knole, Otford, and Canterbury.
It seems, therefore, unlikely that Knole should be
singled out as a “great house” unless there were good
justification for the expression.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bourchier also built the Brown Gallery about 1460,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and at or about the same date he put up the machicolations
over the gate-house between the Green Court and
the Stone Court. Towards the end of the same century,
Morton, his successor, “threw out an oriel
window which rendered the machicolations useless,
and showed that all idea of such fortifications was at an
end.” It is not known precisely how much Morton
built at Knole. It is even uncertain whether he or
Bourchier built the Chapel. The Lambeth records
cease with some small repairs in 1487–88, so we
have nothing to go upon—all the more pity, for
Morton was a great prelate, forgotten now in the
greater fame of the Tudor dynasty, “his name
buried,” says his chronicler, “under his own creation.”
This cardinal, having succeeded Bourchier in 1486,
held the Primacy for fourteen years, and died at Knole
in 1500. I pass over his successors, Dean and Wareham,
for I do not know how much they did at Knole.
Cranmer, the next archbishop, enjoyed the house for
seven years only, when he was compelled—quite
amicably, but nevertheless compelled—to present it to
Henry VIII, whose fancy it had taken. Here the
accounts begin again,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a> although they give very little
indication: £872 by Royal Warrant in 1543, £770 in
1548, £80 in 1546—three sums which would now be
equivalent, roughly, to £30,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>After Henry VIII Knole continued as Crown
property, passing now and then temporarily into the
hands of various favourites, until in 1586 it was given
by Queen Elizabeth to her cousin, Thomas Sackville,
and has remained in the possession of his family ever
since.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>§ iv</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The main block, therefore, meanders from Henry
VII through Henry VIII to Elizabeth and James I:
that is to say, roughly, from the end of the fifteenth
century to the beginning of the seventeenth. There
may be earlier out-buildings and later excrescences,
but it is safe to say that the greater portion was built
in the reigns of the Tudors. It is all of the same
Kentish rag, with the exception of a row of gables
which have been plastered over, and which were probably
once of the beam-and-plaster fashion so prevalent
at that date in Kent. With this exception the walls are
of the grey stone, in many places ten and twelve feet
thick, cool in summer, and, for some reason, not particularly
warm in winter. The rooms are, for the most
part, rather small and rather low; they break out, of
course, now into galleries, now into a ball-room, now
into a banqueting-hall, but the majority of them are
small, friendly rooms—not intimidating; some people
might even think them poky, relative to the size of the
house. I do not think that they are poky. They are
eminently rooms intended to be lived in, and not
merely admired, though no doubt a practical consideration
was present in the problem of heating to
determine their size. Yet from an old diary preserved
at Knole, and from which in its place I shall have the
opportunity to give extracts, it is clear that in the
early seventeenth century at all events the life of the
house was carried on largely in one or the other of the
long galleries. Now, none of the galleries has more than
one fireplace. It must have been very cold. The old
braziers that could be carried about the room as
occasion required still stand in the rooms where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>were used, and so do the copper warming-pans, shining
and perforated, which were thrust into the beds to
warm them before the arrival of the occupant. The
principal beds, of course, must have been magnificently
stuffy. They are four-posters, so tall as to
reach from floor to ceiling, with stiff brocaded curtains
that could completely enclose the sleeper. But
on winter days I cannot believe that the group ever
moved very far away from the fireplace or the brazier;
and indeed, judging from the same diary, they seemed
always to be “keeping their chamber” on account of
coughs, colds, rheumatism, or ague when they were
not keeping it because they were “sullen” with one
another, or “brought to bed” of a son or a daughter.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ v</h3>

<p class='c017'>The galleries are perhaps the most characteristic
rooms in such a house.</p>

<p>THE STONE COURT: BOURCHIER’S GATEHOUSE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Long and narrow, with dark shining floors, armorial
glass in the windows, rich plaster-work ceilings, and
portraits on the walls, they are splendidly sombre and
sumptuous. The colour of the Cartoon Gallery, when
I have come into it in the evening, with the sunset
flaming through the west window, has often taken my
breath away. I have stood, stock still and astonished,
in the doorway. The gallery is ninety feet in length,
the floor formed of black oak planks irregularly laid,
the charm of which is that they are not planks at all,
but solid tree-trunks, split in half, with the rounded
half downwards; and on this oak flooring lie the blue
and scarlet patches from the stained west window, more
subduedly echoed in the velvets of the chair coverings,
the coloured marbles of the great Renaissance fireplace, and the fruits and garlands of the carved woodwork
surrounding the windows. There is nothing
garish: all the colours have melted into an old
harmony that is one of the principal beauties of these
rooms. The walls here in the Cartoon Gallery are hung
with rose-red Genoa velvet, so lovely that I almost
regret Mytens’ copies of the Raphael cartoons hiding
most of it; but if, at Knole, one were too nicely
reluctant to sacrifice the walls, whether panelled or
velvet-hung, then all the pictures would have to be
stacked on the floor of the attics. The same regret
applies to the ball-room, where the Elizabethan
panelling—oak, but originally painted white, turned
by age to ivory—is so covered up as to be unnoticeable
behind the Sackville portraits of ten generations.
Fortunately, the frieze in the ball-room cannot be
hidden. It used to delight me as a child, with its carved
intricacies of mermaids and dolphins, mermen and
mermaids with scaly, twisting tails and salient anatomy,
and I was invariably contemptuous of those visitors to
whom I pointed out the frieze but who were more
interested in the pictures. It always fell to my lot to
“show the house” to visitors when I was living there
alone with my grandfather, for he shared the family
failing of unsociability, and whenever a telegram
arrived threatening invasion he used to take the next
train to London for the day, returning in the evening
when the coast was clear. It mattered nothing that
I was every whit as bored by the invasion as he could
have been; in a divergence between the wishes of
eighty and the wishes of eight, the wishes of eight
went to the wall.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ vi</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There are other galleries, older and more austere
than the Cartoon Gallery. They are not quite so long,
they are narrower, lower, and darker, and not so
exuberant in decoration; indeed, they are simply and
soberly panelled in oak. They have the old, musty
smell which, to me, whenever I met it, would bring
back Knole. I suppose it is really the smell of all old
houses—a mixture of woodwork, pot-pourri, leather,
tapestry, and the little camphor bags which keep away
the moth; the smell engendered by the shut windows
of winter and the open windows of summer, with the
breeze of summer blowing in from across the park.
Bowls of lavender and dried rose-leaves stand on the
window-sills; and if you stir them up you get the
quintessence of the smell, a sort of dusty fragrance,
sweeter in the under layers where it has held the damp
of the spices. The pot-pourri at Knole is always made
from the recipe of a prim-looking little old lady who
lived there for many years as a guest in the reigns of
George I and George II. Her two rooms open out of
one of the galleries, two of the smallest rooms in the
house, the bedroom hung with a pale landscape of
blue-green tapestry, the sitting-room panelled in oak;
and in the bedroom stands her small but pompous bed,
with bunches of ostrich-plumes nodding at each of the
four corners. Strangers usually seem to like these two
little rooms best, coming to them as they do, rather
overawed by the splendour of the galleries; they are
amused by the smallness of the four-poster, square as a
box, its creamy lining so beautifully quilted; by the
spinning-wheel, with the shuttle still full of old flax;
and by the ring-box, containing a number of plain-cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>stones, which could be exchanged at will into the
single gold setting provided. The windows of these
rooms, furthermore, look out on to the garden; they
are human, habitable little rooms, reassuring after the
pomp of the Ball-room and the galleries. In the
sitting-room there is a small portrait of the prim lady,
Lady Betty Germaine, sitting very stiff in a blue
brocaded dress; she looks as though she had been a
martinet in a tight, narrow way.</p>

<p class='c018'>The gallery leading to these rooms is called the
Brown Gallery. It is well named—oak floor, oak
walls, and barrelled ceiling, criss-crossed with oak
slats in a pattern something like cat’s cradle. Some of
the best pieces of the English furniture are ranged
down each side of this gallery: portentously important
chairs, Jacobean cross-legged or later love-seats in
their original coverings, whether of plum and silver,
or red brocade with heavy fringes, or green with silver
fringes, or yellow silk sprigged in black, or powder-blue;
and all have their attendant stool squatting
beside them. They are lovely, silent rows, for ever
holding out their arms, and for ever disappointed. At
the end of this gallery is a tiny oratory, down two
steps, for the use of the devout: this little, almost
secret, place glows with colour like a jewel, but nobody
ever notices it, and on the whole it probably prefers
to hide itself away unobserved.</p>

<p class='c018'>There is also the Leicester Gallery, which preserves in
its name the sole trace of Lord Leicester’s brief ownership
of Knole. The Leicester Gallery is very dark and
mysterious, furnished with red velvet Cromwellian
farthingale chairs and sofas, dark as wine; there are
illuminated scrolls of two family pedigrees—Sackville
and Curzon—richly emblazoned with coats of arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>drawn out in 1589 and 1623 respectively; and in the
end window there is a small stained-glass portrait of
“Herbrand de Sackville, a Norman notable, came into
England with William the Conqueror, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1066.”
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Herbrandus de Sackville, Praepotens Normanus,
intravit Angliam cum Gulielmo Conquestore, Anno
Domini MLXVI.</span></i>) There is also a curious portrait
hanging on one of the doors, of Catherine Fitzgerald
Countess of Desmond, the portrait of a very old lady,
in a black dress and a white ruff, with that strange
far-away look in her dead blue eyes that comes with
extreme age. For tradition says of her that she was
born in the reign of Edward the Fourth and died in
the reign of Charles the First, breaking her leg
incidentally at the age of ninety by falling off a cherry
tree; that is to say, she was a child when the princes
were smothered in the Tower, a girl when Henry the
Seventh came to the throne, and watched the pageant
of all the Tudors and the accession of the Stuarts—the
whole of English history enclosed between the Wars
of the Roses and the Civil War. She must have been a
truly legendary figure in the country by the time she
had reached the age of a hundred and forty or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is rather a frightening portrait, that portrait of
Lady Desmond. If you go into the gallery after nightfall
with a candle the pale, far-away eyes stare past
you into the dark corners of the wainscot, eyes either
over-charged or empty—which? The house is not
haunted, but you require either an unimaginative
nerve or else a complete certainty of the house’s
benevolence before you can wander through the state-rooms
after nightfall with a candle. The light gleams
on the dull gilding of furniture and into the misty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>depths of mirrors, and startles up a sudden face out
of the gloom; something creaks and sighs; the
tapestry sways, and the figures on it undulate and seem
to come alive. The recesses of the great beds, deep in
shadow, might be inhabited, and you would not know
it; eyes might watch you, unseen. The man with the
candle is under a terrible disadvantage to the man in
the dark.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ vii</h3>

<p class='c017'>As there are three galleries among the state-rooms, so
are there three principal bedrooms: the King’s, the
Venetian Ambassador’s, and the Spangled Room. The
King’s bedroom is the only vulgar room in the house.
Not that the furniture put there for the reception of
James the First is vulgar: it is excessively magnificent,
the canopy of the immense bed reaching almost to the
ceiling, decked with ostrich feathers, the hangings stiff
with gold and silver thread, the coverlet and the interior
of the curtains heavily embroidered with a design
of pomegranates and tiger-lilies worked in silver on a
coral satin ground, the royal cipher embossed over the
pillows—all this is very magnificent, but not vulgar.
What is vulgar is the set of furniture made entirely in
silver: table, hanging mirror, and tripods—the florid
and ostentatious product of the florid Restoration. There
is a surprising amount of silver in the room: sconces,
ginger-jars, mirrors, fire-dogs, toilet-set, rose-water
sprinklers, even to a little eye-bath, all of silver, but these
smaller objects have not the blatancy of the set of furniture.
Charles Sackville, for whom it was made, cannot
have known when he had had enough of a good thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is almost a relief to go from here to the Venetian
Ambassador’s Bedroom. Green and gold; Burgundian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>tapestry, mediaeval figures walking in a
garden; a rosy Persian rug—of all rooms I never saw
a room that so had over it a bloom like the bloom on a
bowl of grapes and figs. I cannot keep the simile,
which may convey nothing to those who have not
seen the room, out of my mind. Greens and pinks
originally bright, now dusted and tarnished over. It
is a very grave, stately room, rather melancholy in
spite of its stateliness. It seems to miss its inhabitants
more than do any of the other rooms. Perhaps this
is because the bed appears to be designed for three:
it is of enormous breadth, and there are three pillows
in a row. Presumably this is what the Italians call a
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">letto matrimoniale</span></i>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ viii</h3>

<p class='c017'>In a remote corner of the house is the Chapel of
the Archbishops, small, and very much bejewelled.
Tapestry, oak, and stained-glass—the chapel smoulders
with colour. It is greatly improved since the oak
has been pickled and the mustard-yellow paint
removed, also the painted myrtle-wreaths, tied with a
gilt ribbon, in the centre of each panel, with which the
nineteenth century adorned it, when it was considered
“very simple, plain, and neat in its appearance, and
well adapted for family worship.” The hand of the
nineteenth century fell rather heavily on the chapel:
besides painting the oak yellow and the ceiling blue
with gold stars, it erected a Gothic screen and a yellow
organ; but fortunately these are both at the entrance,
and you can turn your back on them and look down
the little nave to the altar where Mary Queen of Scots’
gifts stand under the Perpendicular east window. All
along the left-hand wall hangs the Gothic tapestry—scenes from the life of Christ, the figures, ungainly
enough, trampling on an edging of tall irises and
lilies exquisitely designed; and “Saint Luke in his
first profession,” wrote Horace Walpole irreverently,
“holding a urinal.” There used to be other tapestries
in the house; there was one of the Seven Deadly
Sins set, woven with gold threads, and there was
another series, very early, representing the Flood and
the two-by-two procession of the animals going into
a weather-boarded Ark; but these, alas, had to be
sold, and are now in America.</p>

<p>THE STONE COURT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The chapel looks strange and lovely during a midnight
thunderstorm: the lightning flashes through the
stone ogives of the east window, and one gets a queer
effect, unreal like colour photography, of the colours
lit up by that unfamiliar means. A flight of little
private steps leads out of my bedroom straight into the
Family Pew; so I dare to say that there are few aspects
under which I have not seen the chapel; and as a child
I used to “take sanctuary” there when I had been
naughty: that is to say, fairly often. They never
found me, sulking inside the pulpit.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ix</h3>

<p class='c017'>There would, of course, be many other aspects from
which I might consider Knole; indeed, if I allowed
myself full licence I might ramble out over Kent and
down into Sussex, to Lewes, Buckhurst, and Withyham,
out into the fruit country and the hop country,
across the Weald, over Saxonbury, and to Lewes
among the Downs, and still I should not feel guilty of
irrelevance. Of whatever English county I spoke,
I still should be aware of the relationship between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>English soil and that most English house. But more
especially do I feel this concerning Kent and Sussex,
and concerning the roads over which the Sackvilles
travelled so constantly between estate and estate. The
place-names in their letters recur through the centuries;
the paper is a little yellower as the age increases,
the ink a little more faded, the handwriting a little less
easily decipherable, but still the gist is always the same:
“I go to-morrow into Kent,” “I quit Buckhurst for
Knole,” “my Lord rode to Lewes with a great company,”
“we came to Knole by coach at midnight.”
The whole district is littered with their associations,
whether a village whose living lay in their gift, or a
town where they endowed a college, or a wood where
they hunted, or the village church where they had
themselves buried. Sussex, in fact, was their cradle
long before they came into Kent. Buckhurst, which
they had owned since the twelfth century, was at one
time an even larger house than Knole, and to their own
vault in its parish church of Withyham they were
invariably brought to rest. Their trace is scattered
over the two counties. But this was not my only meaning;
I had in mind that Knole was no mere
excrescence, no alien fabrication, no startling stranger
seen between the beeches and the oaks. No other
country but England could have produced it, and into
no other country would it settle with such harmony
and such quiet. The very trees have not been banished
from the courtyards, but spread their green against the
stone. From the top of a tower one looks down upon
the acreage of roofs, and the effect is less that of a
palace than of a jumbled village upon the hillside. It
is not an incongruity like Blenheim or Chatsworth,
foreign to the spirit of England. It is, rather, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>greater relation of those small manor-houses which hide
themselves away so innumerably among the counties,
whether built of the grey stone of south-western
England, or the brick of East Anglia, or merely tile-hung
or plastered like the cottages. It is not utterly
different from any of these. The great Palladian
houses of the eighteenth century are <em>in</em> England, they
are not <em>of</em> England, as are these irregular roofs, this
easy straying up the contours of the hill, these cool
coloured walls, these calm gables, and dark windows
mirroring the sun.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>You come out of the cool shadowy house on to
the warm garden, in the summer, and there is a
scared flutter of white pigeons up to the roof as
you open the door. You have to look twice before you
are sure whether they are pigeons or magnolias. The
turf is of the most brilliant green; there is a sound of
bees in the limes; the heat quivers like watered gauze
above the ridge of the lawn. The garden is entirely
enclosed by a high wall of rag, very massively built,
and which perhaps dates back to the time of the archbishops;
its presence, I think, gives a curious sense
of seclusion and quiet. Inside the walls are herbaceous
borders on either side of long green walks, and little
square orchards planted with very old apple-trees,
under which grow iris, snapdragon, larkspur, pansies,
and such-like humble flowers. There are also interior
walls, with rounded archways through which one
catches a sight of the house, so that the garden is conveniently
divided up into sections without any loss of
the homogeneity of the whole. Half of the garden,
roughly speaking, is formal; the other half is woodland,
called the Wilderness, mostly of beech and chestnut,
threaded by mossy paths which in spring are thick
with bluebells and daffodils.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The old engravings show the gardens to have been,
from the seventeenth century onwards, very much the
same as they are at present. There are a few minor
variations, but as the early engravers were not very
particular as to accuracy their evidence cannot be
accepted as wholly reliable. We have, besides these
engravings, a fairly large number of records relating to
both the park and gardens. The earliest of these that
I have been able to trace is dated 1456, to the effect
that Archbishop Bourchier in that year enclosed the
park—a smaller area then than is covered by it now;
and in 1468 there is a bill, “Paid for making 1000
palings for the enclosure of the Knole land, 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>”
But the first accounts for the garden proper appear to
date from the reign of Henry VIII (State papers of
Henry VIII), when, in 1543, Sir Richard Longe was
paid “for making the King’s garden at Knole.” Then
there is a gap of nearly a century, save for the references
to the garden in Lady Anne Clifford’s Diary, such as
“<em>25th October, 1617</em>. My Lady Lisle and my Coz:
Barbara Sidney [came?] and I walked with them all
the Wilderness over. They saw the Child and much
commended her. I gave them some marmalade of
quince, for about this time I made much of it”; and
her constant notes of how she took her prayer-book
“up to the standing” [which I take to be what we
now call the Duchess’ Seat], or of how she picked
cherries in the garden with the French page, and he
told her how he thought that all the men in the house
loved her. For the year 1692, however, there are some
bills among the Knole papers, such as “Mr. Olloynes,
gardener, wages £12 per annum,” and some bills for
seeds and roots, “Sweet yerbs, pawsley, sorrill,
spinnig, spruts, leeks, sallet, horse-rydish, jerusalem
hawty-chorks,” and another bill for seeds for £2. 0<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em>
Coming to the eighteenth century, there are more
detailed accounts, amongst others an agreement of what
was expected in those days of a head gardener and the
remuneration he might hope to receive:</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><em>14th Aug., 1706.</em> Ric. Baker, Gardener with Lionel Earl
of Dorset and Middlesex. To serve his Lordship as
Gardener at Knole for the term of one year ½ to begin in
March 1706. That he will reserve all the fruit which shall
be growing in the garden for his Lordship’s use. That he
will at his own charge during the said term preserve all
Trees and Greens now in the garden, and will maintain the
trees in good husbandlike manner by pruning and trimming,
dunging and marling the same in seasonable times, and likewise
at his own charge will provide all herbs and other
things convenient for my Lord’s kitchen there when in season.
He undertakes to maintain at his own charge all such walks
as are now in ye said Garden, by mowing, cleaning, and

as are now in the gardens, and that he will be at all the
charges of repairing all the glass frames, etc. belonging to

<p class='c018'>In return for this service he was to be allowed £30
per annum, and</p>

<p class='c021'>rooms and conveniences in the house for his business, and

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>It is not very clear where such a large number of
fruit trees were to be used, but on an engraving of
about 1720 I find a wall extending right across the
garden to the two stone pillars which, surmounted by
carved stone urns, still remain, this wall being planted
with fruit trees, so I should think it very probable that
this would account for it.</p>

<p class='c018'>In 1777 new hot-houses and “Pineries” were built,
and £175 paid for “two hot-houses full stocked with
pine apples and plants.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c017'>Surrounding the house and gardens lies the park,
with its valleys, hills, and woods, and its short brown
turf closely bitten by deer and rabbits. Its beeches and
bracken, its glades and valleys, greatly excited the
admiration of Mrs. Ann Radcliffe, who visited it in the
beginning of the nineteenth century, and she wrote
with enthusiasm of shade rising above shade with
<em>amazing</em> and <em>magnificent</em> grandeur, and of one beech in
particular spreading “its light yet umbrageous fan” over
a seat placed round the bole. With all its grandeur and
luxuriance, she said, there was nothing about this beech
heavy or formal; it was airy, though vast and majestic,
and suggested an idea at once of the <em>strength</em> and <em>fire</em>
of a <em>hero</em>. She would call a beech tree, she added, and
this beech above every other, the hero of the forest, as
the oak was called the king.</p>

<p class='c018'>As I have said, the park was first enclosed by
Bourchier in 1456, the year in which he bought Knole
on the 30th of June. In the muniments at Lambeth
are a number of papers relating to the expenses of this
great builder, and there is the interesting fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>glass-making was carried on in the park, and I only
wish that more detailed accounts existed of this
industry, which, thanks to the Huguenots, had been
pretty widely introduced into the South of England.
I should like to know exactly where their glass-foundry
was, and whether they made use of the sand on the
portion known as the Furze-field, now a rabbit warren;
and I should also very much like to know whether—as
seems probable—they supplied any of the glass for the
windows in the house.</p>

<p class='c018'>It would appear that the park, now entirely under
grass, was once ploughland, for there is at Knole a deed
of the time of Richard Sackville, fifth Earl of Dorset—that
is to say, the middle of the seventeenth century—which
accords to four farmers “the liberty to plough
anywhere in the Park except in the plain set out by my
Lord and the ground in front of the house, and to take
three crops, and it is agreed that one-third of each
crop after it is severed from the ground shall be taken
and carried away by my Lord for his own use. The
third year, the farmers to sow the ground with grass
seed if my Lord desires it, and they are to be at the
charge of the seed, the tillage, and the harvest.” Later
on, in the time of Charles I, hops were grown, not only
around the park, but also in it. Women employed in
picking the hops were paid 5<em>d.</em> a day, but for cleaning
and weeding the ground they only received 3<em>d.</em> At
this time also cattle were fed in the park during the
summer, and belonging to the same date (about 1628)
are the bills for “Moles caught, 1½<em>d.</em> each”; “Mowing
the meadows,” at the rate of 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per acre;
“Making hay,” also at 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per acre; “Carriage of
hay from the meadows to Knole barn,” <a href='#Page_1'>1</a><em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> per
load; “one hay fork and 2 hay forks together,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> For “hunting conies by night and ferret by
day” 4<em>s.</em> was paid; the expenses involved by the
“conies” for one year were exactly £10, which
included £5 5<em>s.</em>, a year’s wages for the “wariner”;
but, on the other hand, this was money well expended,
for the revenue from “conies sold” covers no less
than a fifth part of the year’s total income. The
“wariner,” although his £5 5<em>s.</em> a year hardly seems
excessive, did better than the “wood-looker,” who, for
his woodreeveship for a year, was paid only £2.</p>

<p class='c018'>The accounts of how and when the various outlying
portions of the park were taken in can only be of local
interest, and I do not therefore propose to go into
them. They were mostly bought by John Frederick,
the third duke, and by Lord Whitworth, who had
married John Frederick’s widow. The ruins round the
queer little sham Gothic house called the Bird House—which
always frightened me as a child because I
thought it looked like the witch’s house in Hansel and
Gretel, tucked away in its hollow, with its pointed
gables—were built for John Frederick’s grandfather
about 1761, by one Captain Robert Smith, who had
fought at Minden under Lord George Sackville, of
disastrous notoriety, and who lived for some time at
Knole, a parasite upon the house; they apparently
purport to be the remains of some vast house, in
defiance of the fact that no upper storey or roof of proportionate
dimensions could ever possibly have rested
upon the flimsy structure of flint and rubble which
constitute the ruins. They, together with the Bird
House, form an amusing group of the whims and
vanities of two different ages. But, to go back to the
park, I conclude with the following letter, which is
among the papers at Knole:</p>

<p class='c017'>So much, then, for the setting; but it is no mere
empty scene. The house, with its exits and entrances,
its properties of furniture and necessities, its dressing-tables,
its warming-pans, and its tiny silver eye-bath still
standing between the hair-brushes—the house demands
its population. Whose were the hands that have, by the
constant light running of their fingers, polished the paint
from the banisters? Whose were the feet that have worn
down the flags of the hall and the stone passages? What
child rode upon the ungainly rocking-horse? What
young men exercised their muscles on the ropes of the
great dumb-bell? Who were the men and women that,
after a day’s riding or stitching, lay awake in the deep
beds, idly watching between the curtains the play of the
firelight, and the little round yellow discs cast upon walls
and ceiling through the perforations of the tin canisters
standing on the floor, containing the rush-lights?</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus the house wakes into a whispering life, and we
resurrect the Sackvilles.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Such interest as the Sackvilles have lies, I think,
in their being so representative. From generation
to generation they might stand, fully
equipped, as portraits from English history. Unless
they are to be considered in this light they lose their
purport; they merely share, as Byron wrote to one of
their number:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... <em>with titled crowds the common lot,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>In life just gazed at, in the grave forgot&nbsp;...</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>The mouldering ’scutcheon, or the herald’s roll,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>That well-emblazoned but neglected scroll,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Where lords, unhonoured, in the tomb may find</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>One spot, to leave a worthless name behind:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>There sleep, unnoticed as the gloomy vaults</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>That veil their dust, their follies, and their faults:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>A race with old armorial lists o’erspread</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>In records destined never to be read</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>But let them stand each as the prototype of his age,
and at the same time as a link to carry on, not only the
tradition but also the heredity of his race, and they
immediately acquire a significance, a unity. You have
first the grave Elizabethan, with the long, rather
melancholy face, emerging from the oval frame above
the black clothes and the white wand of office; you
perceive all his severe integrity; you understand the
intimidating austerity of the contribution he made to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>English letters. Undoubtedly a fine old man. You
come down to his grandson: he is the Cavalier by
Vandyck hanging in the hall, hand on hip, his flame-coloured
doublet slashed across by the blue of the
Garter; this is the man who raised a troop of horse off
his own estates and vowed never to cross the threshold
of his house into an England governed by the murderers
of the King. You have next the florid, magnificent
Charles, the fruit of the Restoration, poet, and
patron of poets, prodigal, jovial, and licentious; you have
him full-length, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, in his Garter
robes and his enormous wig, his foot and fine calf well
thrust forward; you have him less pompous and more
intimate, wrapped in a dressing-gown of figured silk, the
wig replaced by an Hogarthian turban; but it is still the
same coarse face, with the heavy jowl and the twinkling
eyes, the crony of Rochester and Sedley, the patron and
host of Pope and Dryden, Prior and Killigrew. You come
down to the eighteenth century. You have on Gainsborough’s
canvas the beautiful, sensitive face of the gay
and fickle duke, spoilt, feared, and propitiated by
the women of London and Paris, the reputed lover
of Marie Antoinette. You have his son, too fair and
pretty a boy, the friend of Byron, killed in the hunting-field
at the age of twenty-one, the last direct male
of a race too prodigal, too amorous, too weak, too
indolent, and too melancholy.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Sackvilles are supposed to have gone into
Normandy in the ninth century with Rollo the Dane,
and to have settled in the neighbourhood of Dieppe,
in a small town called Salcavilla, from which, obviously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>they derived their name. Much as I relish the suggestion
of this Norse origin, I am bound to add that
the first of whom there is any authentic record is
Herbrand de Sackville, contemporary with William
the Conqueror, whom he accompanied to England.
Descending from him is a long monotonous list of Sir
Jordans, Sir Andrews, Sir Edwards, Sir Richards,
carrying us through the Crusades, the French wars,
and the wars of the Roses, but none of whom has the
slightest interest until we get to Sir Richard Sackville,
temp. Henry VIII-Elizabeth—from his wealth called
Sackfill or Fillsack, though not, it appears, “either
griping or penurious,” a man of some note, and thus
qualified by Roger Ascham: “That worthy gentleman,
that earnest favourer and furtherer of God’s true
religion; that faithful servitor to his prince and
country; a lover of learning and all learned men;
wise in all doings; courteous to all persons, showing
spite to none, doing good to many; and, as I well found,
to me so fast a friend as I never lost the like before”;
and in this same connection I may quote further from
Ascham’s preface to <em>The Scholemaster</em>, in which he
records a conversation which took place in 1593
between himself and Sir Richard Sackville, when
dining with Sir William Cecil: Sir Richard, after
complaining of his own education by a bad schoolmaster,
said, “But seeing it is but in vain to lament
things past, and also wisdom to look to things to come,
surely, God willing (if God lend me life), I will make
this my mishap some occasion of good hap to little
Robert Sackville, my son’s son; for whose bringing
up I would gladly, if so please you, use specially your
good advice.”... “I wish also,” says Ascham, “with
all my heart, that young Mr. Robert Sackville may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>take that fruit of this labour that his worthy grandfather
purposed he should have done. And if any other
do take profit or pleasure hereby, they have cause to
thank Mr. Robert Sackville, for whom specially this
my Scholemaster was provided.”</p>

<p class='c018'>This Sir Richard was the founder of the family
fortune, which was to be increased by his son and
squandered after that by nearly all his descendants in
succession. It was he who bought, in 1564, for the sum
of £641 5<em>s.</em> 10½<em>d.</em>, “the whole of the land lying
between Bridewell and Water Lane from Fleet Street
to the Thames.” This property, now of course of
almost fabulous value, included the house then known
as Salisbury House, having belonged to the see of
Salisbury, which presently became Dorset House in
1603, and presently again was divided into Great
Dorset House and Little Dorset House, as the London
house of the Sackvilles. A wall enclosed house and
gardens from the existing line of Salisbury Court
south to the river, and shops and tenements in and near
Fleet Street from St. Bride’s to Water Lane (Whitefriars
Street). These were not the only London possessions
of the Sackvilles. Later on they overflowed into the
Strand, and another Dorset House sprang up, on the
site of the present Treasury in Whitehall, to take the place
of the older house in Salisbury Court, which had been
destroyed in the Great Fire. It is idle and exasperating
to speculate on the modern value of these City estates.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sir Richard Sackville died in 1566, when his son
Thomas was already thirty years of age. Very little is
known about Thomas’ early life; we only know that
he went for a short time to Oxford (Hertford), and
subsequently to the Inner Temple. While at Oxford
he attracted some attention as a poet and writer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sonnets, but I have only been able to find one of these
early sonnets, written for Hoby’s translation of the
<em>Courtier of Count Baldessar Castilio</em> (published in
1561), and which I quote, not so much for its worth as
for its interest as a little-known work from the pen of
one who, as the author of our earliest tragedy, has a
certain renown:</p>

      <div class='line'><em>A rarer work, and richer far in worth,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Castilio’s hand presenteth here to thee:</em></div>

<p>A CONFERENCE OF ENGLISH AND SPANISH PLENIPOTENTIARIES AT SOMERSET HOUSE IN 1604<br /><br /><em>From the painting by</em> <span class='sc'>Marc Gheerhardts</span> <em>at the National Portrait Gallery</em><br /><br />At the top right-hand corner, nearest the window, Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, K.G., Lord High Treasurer of England</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>It seems that Sackville’s works were all written in the
first half of his life, and that later on, as honours came
to him, he altogether abandoned what might have
been a first-rate literary career for a second-rate
political one—more’s the pity. “A born poet,” says
Mr. Gosse, “diverted from poetry by the pursuits
of statesmanship.” He is a very good instance of
the disadvantage of fine birth to a poet. But for the
fact that he was born the Queen’s cousin, through the
Boleyns, and the son of a father holding various distinguished
offices, he might never have entered a
political arena where he was destined to have as competitors
such statesmen as Burleigh, and such favourites
as Leicester and Essex. Amongst his contemporary
poets, Surrey and Wyatt both died while Sackville was
still a child; when Spenser was born, Sackville was
already sixteen; when Sidney was born, he was
eighteen; when Shakespeare was born, he was a full-grown
man of twenty-eight. He had thus the good
fortune to be born at a time when English poets of
much standing were rare, an opportunity of which he
might have taken greater advantage had not the
accident of his birth persuaded him to abandon poetry
for more serious things as the dilettantism of his youth.
For he was comparatively young when he wrote both
<cite>Gorboduc</cite> and the <cite>Induction</cite> to the <cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>.
<cite>Gorboduc</cite> was first performed by the gentlemen
of the Inner Temple before the Queen in 1561, when
Sackville was twenty-five, and the <cite>Induction</cite> was first
published in 1563, when he was twenty-seven; but
already in or about 1557, when he was only just over
twenty, he had composed the plan for the whole of the
<cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>, intending to write it himself,
although subsequently from want of leisure he left the
composition of all but the induction or introduction,
and the <cite>Complaint of Henry, Duke of Buckingham</cite>, to
others.</p>

<p class='c018'>By the age of twenty-one, however, responsibilities
were already upon him. He was married; and he was
a member of Parliament, not merely once but twice
over, as appears from the journals of the House of
Commons: “For that Thomas Sackville, Esq., is
returned for the County of Westmoreland, and also for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the Borough of East Grinstead in Sussex, and doth
personally appear for Westmoreland, it is required by
this House that another person be returned for the said
borough.” How this double election can have come
about I cannot explain. It seems to have done him no
harm in his parliamentary career; not only was he
returned member for Aylesbury in 1563, but he took
an active part in introducing bills, etc. About this time
he went to travel in France and Italy, where for some
mysterious reason he got himself thrown into prison;
the reason was probably pecuniary, for we are told that
he was “of the height of spirit inherent in his house,”
and lived too magnificently for his means; so I think
the assumption is in favour of his having got temporarily
into debt. If, indeed, he shared in any measure
the tastes of his descendants, nothing is more likely.
Back in England again, the successes of his career
rushed upon him. His father was just dead; he was
the head of his family; he inherited its wealth and
estates; he was at the propitious age of thirty; he was
related to the Queen; he was marked out to prosper.
Within the next thirty years or so he was, successively,
knighted and created Lord Buckhurst of Buckhurst,
in the county of Sussex; given the house and lands
of Knole by the Queen, that she might have him near
her court and councils; sent to France and the
Netherlands as special ambassador from Elizabeth;
made a Knight of the Garter; Chancellor of Oxford,
where he sumptuously entertained the Queen; made
Lord High Treasurer of England in 1599; High
Steward of England at the trial of Essex, where he sat
in state under a canopy and pronounced sentence and
an exhortation, says Bacon, “with gravity and
solemnity.” By this time, I imagine, he had in very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>truth become the grave and solemn personage one sees
in all his portraits—not that his mind, even in early
youth, can have been otherwise than grave and solemn
if at the age of twenty he had been capable of imagining
a vast poem on so dreary and Dantesque a plan as the
<cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>, devised, says Morley in his
<cite>English Literature</cite>, “to moralise those incidents of
English history which warn the powerful of the unsteadiness
of fortune by showing them, as in a mirror,
that ‘who reckless rules, right soon may hap to rue.’”
Also, from a letter written by Lord Buckhurst to
Lord Walsingham, it is clear that he had no sympathy
with ostentation, but only with honest worth: “And,
Sir, I beseech you send over as few Court captains as
may be; but that they may rather be furnished with
captains here [in the Low Countries], such as by their
worthiness and long service do merit it, and do further
seek to shine in the field with virtue and valiance
against the enemy than with gold lace and gay garments
in Court at home.” In 1586 Lord Buckhurst
was one of the forty appointed on the commission for
the trial of Mary Stuart, and although his name is not
amongst those who proceeded to Fotheringay, nor
later in the Star Chamber at Westminster when she
was condemned to death, yet he was sent to announce
the sentence to death, and received from her in recognition
of his tact and gentleness in conveying this news
the triptych and carved group of the Procession to
Calvary now on the altar in the chapel at Knole.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was, in fact, absent from none of the councils of
the nation, and I have no doubt that he discharged his
duties with all seriousness and honesty. Poetry—a
frivolous pursuit—had long since been left behind.
The poet had become the statesman. Nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>there were times when his very integrity was the
cause of bringing him into disfavour with the intolerant
mistress he served, notably on one occasion when he
refused to take the part of Leicester and was indignantly
confined to his house for nine or ten months by
Royal mandate. And there was another occasion,
amusing as showing the extreme simplicity in which
even a man like Lord Buckhurst, who had the reputation
of lavish living in his own day, conducted his daily
life. Buckhurst, then being at the royal palace of
Shene, was desired by the Queen to entertain Odet de
Coligny, Cardinal of Chatillon, and did so, but with
the result made clear in the following letter, of which
I give extracts:</p>

<p class='c019'><em>To the Right Honourable the Lords of her Majesty’s Privy
Council be this delivered.</em></p>

<p class='c019'>My duty to your Lordships most humbly remembered.</p>

<p class='c019'>Returning yesterday to Shene, I received as from your
Lordships how her highness stood greatly displeased with
me, for that I had not in better sort entertained the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c018'>He goes on to speak of his “great grief” and his
“sorrowful heart,” especially, he says, “being to her
Majesty as I am,” and proceeds with the attempt to
justify himself for his supposed niggardliness:</p>

<p class='c019'>I brought them in to every part of the house that I
possessed, and showed them all such stuff and furniture as
I had. And where they required plate of me, I told them as
troth is, that I had no plate at all. Such glass vessel as I had
I offered them, which they thought too base; for napery
I could not satisfy their turn, for they desired damask work
for a long table, and I had none other but plain linen for a
square table. The table whereon I dine myself I offered
them, and for that it was a square table they refused it.
One only tester and bedstead not occupied I had, and those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>I delivered for the Cardinal himself, and when we could not
by any means in so short a time procure another bedstead
for the bishop, I assigned them the bedstead on which my
wife’s waiting women did lie, and laid them on the ground.
Mine own basin and ewer I lent to the Cardinal and wanted
myself. So did I the candlesticks for mine own table, with
divers drinking glasses, small cushions, small pots for the
kitchen, and sundry other such like trifles, although indeed
I had no greater store of them than I presently occupied;
and albeit this be not worthy the writing, yet mistrusting
lest the misorder of some others in denying of such like kind
of stuff not occupied by themselves, have been percase
informed as towards me, I have thought good not to omit it.
Long tables, forms, brass for the kitchen, and all such
necessaries as could not be furnished by me, we took order
to provide in the town; hangings and beds we received
from the yeoman of the wardrobe at Richmond, and when
we saw that napery and sheets could nowhere here be had,
I sent word thereof to the officers at the Court, by which
means we received from my lord of Leicester 2 pair of fine
sheets for the Cardinal, and from my lord Chamberlain one
pair of fine for the bishop, with 2 other coarser pair, and
order beside for 10 pair more from London.</p>

<p class='c019'>At which time also because I would be sure your Lordships
should be ascertained of the simpleness and scarcity
of such stuff as I had here, I sent a man of mine to the Court,
specially to declare to your Lordships that for plate, damask,
napery and fine sheets, I had none at all and for the rest
of my stuff neither was it such as with honour might furnish
such a personage, nor yet had I any greater store thereof than
I presently occupied, and he brought me this answer again
from your Lordships that if I had it not I could not lend it.
And yet all things being thus provided for, and the diet for
his Lordship being also prepared, I sent word thereof to
Mr. Kingesmele and thereupon the next day in the morning
about nine of the clock the Cardinal came to Shene where I
met and received him almost a quarter of a mile from the
house, and when I had first brought the Cardinal to his
lodging, and after the bishop to his, I thought good there to
leave them to their repose. Thus having accommodated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Lordship as well as might be with so short a warning, I
thought myself to have fully performed the meaning of your
Lordships’ letters unto me, and because I had tidings the
day before that a house of mine in the country by sudden
chance was burned&nbsp;... I took horse and rode the same
night towards those places, where I found so much of my
house burned as 200 marks will not repair....</p>

<p class='c018'>This is not at all in accordance with his reputation
for hospitality:</p>

<p class='c019'>He kept house for forty and two years in an honourable
proportion. For thirty years of these his family consisted of
little less, in one place or another, than two hundred persons.
But for more than twenty years, besides workmen and other
hired, his number at the least hath been two hundred and
twenty daily, as appeared upon check-role. A very rare
example in this present age of ours, when housekeeping is
so decayed.</p>

<p class='c025'>I think that this reputation, and the enormous sums
which he spent upon the enlargement and beautifying
of Knole, make all the more remarkable the statements
in the foregoing letter: that he had neither napery,
plate, nor sheets, and that in order to provide his guest
with a basin and ewer he was obliged to do without them
himself. It is apparent also from his will that he
indulged himself in the luxury of various musicians,
“some for the voice and some for the instrument,
whom I have found to be honest in their behaviour
and skilful in their profession, and who had often given
me after the labour and painful travels of the day
much recreation and contatation with their delightful
harmony.” “Musicians,” it was said, “the most
curious he could have,” so that in these extravagances
he was not parsimonious, although he disregarded the
common comforts of life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>In June 1566 Queen Elizabeth had presented him
with Knole, but, because the house was then both let
and sub-let, it was not until 1603 that he was able
to take possession. Tradition says that the Queen
bestowed Knole upon him because she wished to have
him nearer to her court and councils, and to spare him
the constant journey between London and Buckhurst,
over the rough, clay-sodden roads of the Weald, at
that date still an uncultivated and almost uninhabited
district, where droves of wild swine rootled for acorns
under the oaks. He does not appear to have spent
very much time at Knole during the first years of his
ownership, for in a letter written in September 1605,
to Lord Salisbury, he says: “I go now to Horsley, and
thence to Knole, where I was not but once in the first
beginnings all the year, whence for three or four days
to Buckhurst, where I was not these seven years.”
This did not prevent him from spending a great deal
of money on the house; unfortunately there is no
record of what he spent between 1603 and 1607, but
for the last ten months of his life alone there is a total,
spent on buildings, material, and stock, for four
thousand one hundred and seven pounds, eleven
shillings, and ninepence—an equivalent, in round
figures, to forty thousand of modern money. To
account for these sums, it is known that he built the
Great Staircase, transformed the Great Hall to its
present state, and put in the plaster-work ceilings and
marble chimney-pieces. He also put up the very
lovely lead water-spouts in the courtyards.</p>

<p class='c018'>The good fortune of Lord Buckhurst did not come
to an end with the death of Queen Elizabeth. He was
one of those who travelled to meet the new King on
his journey down from the North, was confirmed by him
in his tenure of the office of Lord Treasurer, and early in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the following year was created Earl of Dorset. The
illuminated patents of creation are at Knole, showing
portraits of both Elizabeth and James I, not very flattering
to either; and the Lord Treasurer’s chest is at
Knole likewise, a huge coffer covered in leather and
thickly studded with large round-headed brass nails.
There is a warrant, signed by him as Lord Treasurer,
for increasing the duty on tobacco, “That tobacco,
being a drug brought into England of late years in
small quantities, was used and taken by the better sort
only as physic to preserve health; but through evil
custom and the toleration thereof that riotous and
disorderly persons spent most of their time in that idle
vanity.” This warrant, which is dated 1605, shows how
little time had elapsed since its introduction before
tobacco established its popularity.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was now advancing in years, and his own letters
prove that his health was not very good. In one letter,
written to Cecil, he complains that he cannot rest more
than two or three hours in the night at most, also that
he is constantly subject to rheums and cold and coughs,
forced to defend himself with warmth, and to fly the
air in cold or moist weathers. In another letter, also
written to Cecil, he again complains of a cough, and
says that he cannot come abroad for three or four days
at least. But his devotion to his public affairs was
greater than his attention to his health, for he says,
“I have by the space of this month and more foreborne
to take physic by reason of her Majesty’s business, and
now having this only week left for physic I am resolved
to prevent sickness, feeling myself altogether distempered
and filled with humours, so as if her Majesty
should miss me I beseech you in respect hereof to
excuse me.” In 1607, when the old man was seventy-one,
there was a report current in London that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>dead, but on the King sending him a diamond, and
wishing that he might live so long as that ring would
continue, “My Lord Treasurer,” says a letter dated
June 1607, “revived again.” In the following year,
however, he died dramatically in harness, of apoplexy
while sitting at the Council table in Whitehall. His
funeral service took place in Westminster Abbey, but
his body was taken to Withyham, where it now lies
buried in the vault of his ancestors.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>

<p class='c017'>I have dealt as briefly as possible with the Lord
Treasurer’s life, because no one could pretend that the
history of his embassies or his occupations of office
could have any interest save to a student of the age of
Elizabeth. But as a too-much-neglected poet I should
like presently to quote the opinions of those well
qualified to judge, showing that he was, at least, something
of a pioneer in English literature—crude, of
course, and uniformly gloomy; too gloomy to read,
save as a labour of love or conscience; but nevertheless
the author—or part-author—of the earliest
English tragedy, and, in some passages, a poet of a
certain sombre splendour. That he was a true poet,
I think, is unquestionable, unlike his descendant
Charles, who by virtue of one song in particular continues
to survive in anthologies, but who was probably
driven into verse by the fashion of his age rather than
by any genuine urgency of creation.</p>

<p class='c018'>The tragedy of <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, whose title was afterwards
altered to <cite>Ferrex and Porrex</cite>, was written in collaboration
with Thomas Norton, although the exact
share of each author is not precisely known and has
been much argued.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>To the modern reader [says Professor Saintsbury]
<cite>Gorboduc</cite> is scarcely inviting, but that is not a condition of
its attractiveness to its own contemporaries. [It] is of the
most painful regularity; and the scrupulosity with which
each of the rival princes is provided with a counsellor and a
parasite to himself, and the other parts are allotted with
similar fairness, reaches such a point that it is rather surprising
that <cite>Gorboduc</cite> was not provided with two queens—a
good and a bad. But even these faults are perhaps less trying
to the modern reader than the inchoate and unpolished condition
of the metre in the choruses, and indeed in the blank
verse dialogue. Here and there there are signs of the stateliness
and poetical imagery of the <cite>Induction</cite>, but for the most
part the decasyllables stop dead at their close and begin
afresh at their beginning with a staccato movement and a
dull monotony of cadence which is inexpressibly tedious.</p>

<p class='c018'>Professor Saintsbury rightly points out that the dullness
of <cite>Gorboduc</cite> to our ideas is not a criterion of the
effect it produced on readers of its own day. Sir Philip
Sidney, for example, while excepting it from the
particular charges he brings against all other English
tragedies and comedies, and granting that “it is full
of stately speeches and well-sounding phrases, climbing
to the height of Seneca his style, and as full of notable
morality, which it doth most delightfully teach, and so
obtain the very end of poesy,” finds fault with it in an
unexpected quarter, namely, that it fails in two unities,
of time and place, so that the modern criticism of its
“painful regularity” was far from occurring to a mind
intent upon a yet more rigorous form.</p>

<p class='c019'>In spite of its manifest imperfections [says the Cambridge
Modern History], the tragedy of <cite>Gorboduc</cite> has two supreme
claims to honourable commemoration. It introduced
Englishmen who knew no language but their own to an
artistic conception of tragedy, and it revealed to them the
true mode of tragic expression.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>I might also quote here the sonnet of a greater poet,
who owed much, if not to <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, at least to the
<cite>Induction</cite>—Edmund Spenser.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>There is also a sonnet by Joshua Sylvester, of which
I will only quote the anagram prefixed to it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sackvilus             <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comes Dorsetius</span></div>

<p class='c018'>But although there can scarcely be two opinions
about <cite>Gorboduc</cite>—that it is sometimes noble, and always
dull—Sackville’s two other poems, the <cite>Induction</cite> to the
<cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite> and the <cite>Complaint of Henry
Duke of Buckingham</cite>, have never met with the recognition
they deserve, save for the discriminating applause
of men of letters. I do not say that they are
works which can be read through with an unvarying
degree of pleasure; there are stagnant passages which
have to be waded through in between the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>admirable portions. But such portions, when they are
reached, do contain much of the genuine stuff of
poetry, impressive imagery, a surprising absence of
cumbersome expression—especially when the reader
bears in mind that Sackville was writing before Spenser,
and long before Marlowe—and a diction which is consistently
dignified and suitable to the gravity of the
theme. Take these stanzas for instance:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>And first within the porch and jaws of hell</em></div>

      <div class='line'><em>To sob and sigh; but ever thus lament,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>With thoughtful care, as she that, all in vain,</em></div>

      <div class='line'><em>His cap borne up with staring of his hair,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>’Stoin’d and amazed at his own shade for dread</em></div>

<p class='c018'>These stanzas are from the <cite>Induction</cite>. Or take

<p class='c018'>These quotations will give some kind of idea of
Sackville’s matter and manner, and of the <cite>Mirror</cite>,
which survives among the classic monuments of
English poetry, says Courthope, only by virtue of the
genius of Sackville. For the rest, not wishing to be
thought prejudiced, I should like to quote copiously
from Professor Saintsbury’s <cite>Elizabethan Literature</cite>,
since therein is expressed, a great deal better than I
could express it, my own view of Sackville’s poetry,
and by calling in the testimony of so excellent,
scholarly, and delightful an authority I may be freed
from the charge of partiality which I should not at all
like to incur.</p>

<p class='c019'>The next remarkable piece of work done in English
poetry after Tottel’s <cite>Miscellany</cite>—a piece of work of greater
actual poetic merit than anything in the <cite>Miscellany</cite> itself—was&nbsp;... the famous <cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>, or rather that
part of it contributed by Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst....
The <cite>Induction</cite> and the <cite>Complaint of Buckingham</cite>,
which Sackville furnished to it in 1559, though they were
not published till four years later, completely outweigh all
the rest in value. His contributions to the <cite>Mirror for Magistrates</cite>
contain the best poetry written in the English language
between Chaucer and Spenser, and are most certainly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>originals or at least the models of some of Spenser’s finest
work. He has had but faint praise of late years.... I have
little hesitation in saying that no more astonishing contribution
to English poetry, when the due reservations of
that historical criticism which is the life of all criticism are
made, is to be found anywhere. The bulk is not great:
twelve or fifteen hundred lines must cover the whole of it.
The form is not new, being merely the 7–line stanza already
familiar in Chaucer. The arrangement is in no way novel,
combining as it does the allegorical presentment of embodied
virtues, vices, and qualities with the melancholy narrative
common in poets for many years before. But the poetical
value of the whole is extraordinary. The two constituents of
that value, the formal and the material, are represented here
with a singular equality of development. There is nothing
here of Wyatt’s floundering prosody, nothing of the well-intentioned
doggerel in which Surrey himself indulges and
in which his pupils simply revel. The cadences of the verse
perfect, the imagery fresh and sharp, the presentation of
nature singularly original, when it is compared with the
battered copies of the poets with whom Sackville must have
been most familiar, the followers of Chaucer from Occleeve
to Hawes. Even the general plan of the poem—the weakest
part of nearly all poems of this time—is extraordinarily
effective and makes one sincerely sorry that Sackville’s taste
or his other occupations did not permit him to carry out the
whole scheme on his own account. The <cite>Induction</cite>, in which
the author is brought face to face with Sorrow, and the
central passages of the <cite>Complaint of Buckingham</cite>, have a
depth and fullness of poetical sound and sense for which we
must look backwards a hundred and fifty years, or forwards
nearly five and twenty....</p>

<p class='c019'>He has not indeed the manifold music of Spenser—it
would be unreasonable to expect that he should have it.
But his stanzas are of remarkable melody, and they have
about them a command, a completeness of accomplishment
within the writer’s intentions, which is very noteworthy in
so young a man. The extraordinary richness and stateliness
of the measure has escaped no critic. There is indeed a
certain one-sidedness about it, and a devil’s advocate might
urge that a long poem couched in verse (let alone the subject)
of such unbroken gloom would be intolerable. But
Sackville did not write a long poem, and his complete command
within his limits of the effect at which he evidently
aimed is most remarkable.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The second thing to note about the poem is the extraordinary
freshness and truth of its imagery. From a young
poet we always expect second-hand presentations of nature,
and in Sackville’s day second-hand presentation of nature
had been elevated to the rank of a science.... It is perfectly
clear that Thomas Sackville had, in the first place, a
poetical eye to see, within as well as without, the objects of
poetical presentment; in the second place, a poetical
vocabulary in which to clothe the results of his seeing; and
in the third place, a poetical ear by aid of which to arrange
his language in the musical co-ordination necessary to poetry.
Wyatt had been notoriously wanting in the last; Surrey had
not been very obviously furnished with the first; and all
three were not to be possessed by anyone else till Edmund
Spenser arose to put Sackville’s lessons in practice on a wider
scale and with a less monotonous lyre. It is possible that
Sackville’s claims in drama may have been exaggerated—they
have of late years rather been undervalued; but his
claims in poetry proper can only be overlooked by those who
decline to consider the most important part of poetry. In
the subject of even his part of the <cite>Mirror</cite> there is nothing
new; there is only a following of Chaucer, and Gower, and
Occleeve, and Lydgate, and Hawes, and many others. But
in the handling there is one novelty which makes all others
of no effect or interest: it is the novelty of a new poetry.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> Knole in the Reign of James I<br /> RICHARD SACKVILLE<br /> <span class='large'>3rd<br /> Earl <em>of</em> Dorset<br /> <em>and</em></span><br /> LADY ANNE CLIFFORD</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>It so happens that a remarkably complete record
has been left of existence at Knole in the early
seventeenth century—an existence compounded of
extreme prodigality of living, tedium, and perpetual
domestic quarrels. We have a private diary, in which
every squabble and reconciliation between Lord and
Lady Dorset is chronicled; every gown she wore;
every wager he won or lost (and he made many);
every book she read; every game she played at Knole
with the steward or with the neighbours; every time
she wept; every day she “sat still, thinking the time
to be very tedious.” We have even a complete list of
the servants and their functions, from Mr. Matthew
Caldicott, my Lord’s favourite, down to John
Morockoe, a Blackamoor. It would, out of this
quantity of information, be possible to reconstruct a
play of singular accuracy.</p>

<p class='c018'>The author of the diary was a lady of some fame and
a great deal of character: Lady Anne Clifford, the
daughter and sole heiress of George, Earl of Cumberland,
and wife to Richard, Earl of Dorset. Cumberland
was himself a picturesque figure. He was Elizabeth’s
official champion at all jousts and tilting, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>nobleman of great splendour, and in addition to this
display of truly Elizabethan glitter and parade he had
the other facet of Elizabethan <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i>: the love of
adventure, which carried him eleven times to sea, to
the Indies and elsewhere, “for the service of Queen
Elizabeth,” says his daughter in the life she wrote of
him, “for the good of England, and of his own
person.” She gives an account of her own appearance:</p>

<p class='c019'>I was very happy in my first constitution both in mind
and body, both for internal and external endowments, for
never was there child more equally resembling both father
and mother than myself. The colour of mine eyes were
black, like my father, and the form and aspect of them was
quick and lively, like my mother’s; the hair of my head was
brown and very thick, and so long that it reached to the calf
of my legs when I stood upright, with a peak of hair on my
forehead and a dimple in my chin like my father, full
cheeks and round face like my mother, and an exquisite
shape of body resembling my father.</p>

<p class='c018'>After this description, more remarkable for exactness
perhaps than for modesty, she adds:</p>

<p class='c019'>But now time and age hath long since ended all these
beauties, which are to be compared to the grass of the field
(<cite>Isaiah</cite> xl., 6, 7, 8; <cite>1 Peter</cite> i., 24). For now when I caused
these memorables of my self to be written I have passed the
63rd year of my age.</p>

<p class='c018'>Having put this in by way of a saving clause, she proceeds
again complacently:</p>

<p class='c019'>And though I say it, the perfections of my mind were
much above those of my body; I had a strong and copious
memory, a sound judgement, and a discerning spirit, and so
much of a strong imagination in me as that many times even
my dreams and apprehensions beforehand proved to be
true; so as old Mr. John Denham, a great astronomer, that
sometime lived in my father’s house, would often say that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>I had much in me in nature to show that the sweet influences
of the Pleiades and the bands of Orion were powerful both
at my conception and my nativity.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was innocent of unnecessary diffidence. Yet she
was not without gratitude:</p>

<p class='c019'>I must not forget to acknowledge that in my infancy and
youth, and a great part of my life, I have escaped many
dangers, both by fire and water, by passage in coaches and
falls from horses, by burning fevers, and excessive extremity
of bleeding many times to the great hazard of my life, all
which, and many cunning and wicked devices of my enemies,
I have escaped and passed through miraculously, and much
the better by the help and prayers of my devout mother,
who incessantly begged of God for my safety and preservation
(<em>Jas.</em> v., 16).</p>

<p class='c018'>To her mother she seems to have been excessively
devoted; and indeed, in the midst of this stubborn
and peremptory character, the most vulnerable spot is
her tenderness for her relations; those of her relations,
that is to say, with whom she was not at mortal enmity.</p>

<p class='c018'>The death of Queen Elizabeth, which occurred
when Anne Clifford was a girl of thirteen, was a disappointment
to her in more ways than one, for “if
Queen Elizabeth had lived she intended to prefer me
to be of the Privy Chamber, for at that time there was
as much hope and expectation of me as of any other
young lady whatsoever,” and moreover “my Mother
and Aunt of Warwick being mourners, I was not
allowed to be one, because I was not high enough,
which did much trouble me then.” She was not even
allowed the privilege of watching by the great Queen’s
body after it had come “by night in a Barge from
Richmond to Whitehall, my Mother and a great Company
of Ladies attending it, where it continued a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>while standing in the Drawing Chamber, where it was
watched all night by several Lords and Ladies, my
Mother sitting up with it two or three nights, but my
Lady would not give me leave to watch, by reason
I was held too young.” It is to be regretted that the
writer, who possessed so vivid and unself-conscious a
pen, should have been thus defrauded of setting upon
record the scene in which the old Queen, stiff as an
effigy, and blazing with the jewels of England, lay for
the last time in state, by the light of candles, among the
great nobles whom in her lifetime she had bullied and
governed, and whom even in death the rigidity of that
bejezabelled presence could still overawe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Although she had not been allowed to see the dead
Queen, Lady Anne was taken to see the new King, but
did not find the court to her liking:</p>

<p class='c019'>We all went to Tibbalds to see the King, who used my
Mother and Aunt very graciously, but we all saw a great
change between the fashion of the Court as it is now and of
that in the Queen’s time, for we were all lousy by sitting in
the chamber of Sir Thomas Erskine.</p>

<p class='c018'>This unpropitious introduction was the first she had
to James I, but it was by no means her last meeting
with him, for she relates several later on which might
more properly be called encounters.</p>

<p class='c018'>About two years after Elizabeth’s death Lord
Cumberland died, “very patiently and willingly of a
bloody flux,” leaving Anne Clifford his only surviving
child and heiress, then being aged about fifteen years.
Her father cannot have been much more than a name
to her, for although “endowed with many perfections
of nature befitting so noble a personage, as an
excellent quickness of wit and apprehension, an active
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and strong body, and an affable disposition and
behaviour,” he “fell to love a lady of quality,” which
created a breach between himself and his wife, and
“when my Mother and he did meet, their countenance
did show the dislike they had one of another, yet he
would speak to me in a slight fashion and give me his
blessing.... My Father used to come to us sometimes
at Clerkenwell, but not often, for he had at this
time as it were wholly left my Mother, yet the house
was kept still at his charge.” All this early part of her
life, I ought to explain, is related by her in the Lives
of her parents and herself, which she compiled in her
old age; and partly from a diary of reminiscences, a
transcript of which is at Knole, and which she appears
to have written at the same time as the more detailed
Diary which she was then (1616–1619) keeping from
day to day. She had a happy childhood with her
mother, and cousins of her own age—“All this time
we were merry at North Hall. My Coz. Frances
Bouchier and my Coz. Francis Russell and I did use
to walk much in the garden, and were great with one
another. I used to wear my Hair-coloured Velvet
every day, and learned to sing and play on the Bass-Viol
of Jack Jenkins, my Aunt’s boy.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The Diary at Knole jumps without any warning or
transition from the reminiscences of youth to 1616.
It begins with a sad little hint of the weariness that was
to follow: “All the time I stayed in the country I was
sometimes merry and sometimes sad, as I had news from
London.” She had then been married for seven years
to Richard Sackville, third Earl of Dorset, grandson
to Queen Elizabeth’s old Treasurer, who was himself
anxious for the match, writing to Sir George Moore
about “that virtuous young lady, the Lady Anne
Clifford,” and soliciting Moore’s good offices with Lady
Cumberland.</p>

<p>RICHARD SACKVILLE, <span class='sc'>3rd Earl of Dorset, K.G.</span><br /><br /><em>From the miniature by</em> <span class='sc'>Isaac Oliver</span> <em>in the Victoria and Albert Museum</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>There were, in all, five children of the marriage:
three little boys, who all “died young at Knole where
they were born,” and two little girls, of whom
Margaret, born in 1614, figures largely in the Diary
and is the only one to concern us, since Isabel was
not born till some years after Lady Anne had ceased
to keep the Diary. Lady Anne’s mother travelled to
London from the North in order to be present at the
birth of Margaret, the first child; but by a strange mischance
the journey was rendered vain, for, having gone
“into the Tower of London to see some friends there,
where, the gates being shut up by an accident that
happened, she was kept there till after her daughter
was delivered of her first child, though she had made
a journey purposely from Appleby Castle, in Westmoreland,
to London.” Not only does the Diary
contain constant references to this little girl, but Lady
Anne’s letters to her mother, now at Appleby, are
rarely without some comment—</p>

<p class='c021'>she begins to break out very much upon her head, which
I hope will make her very healthful [a curious theory]. She
hath yet no teeth come out, but they are most of them
swelled in the flesh, so that now and then they make her
very froward. I have found your Ladyship’s words true
about the nurse had for her, for she hath been one of the
most unhealthfullest women that I think ever was, and so
extremely troubled with the toothache and rheums and
swelling in her face as could be, and one night she fell very
ill, and was taken like an ague so as she had but little milk
left, and so I was enforced to send for the next woman that
was by to give my child suck, whom hath continued with
her ever since, and I thank God the child agrees so well with
her milk as may be, so I mean not to change her any more.
It is a miracle to me that the child should prosper so well.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>She is but a little one, I confess, but a livelier and merrier
thing was there never yet seen.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dorset also was fond of the little girl, for in other
letters to her mother Anne says, after apologising for
her bad writing, which she terms “scribbling,” “my
Lord is as fond of her as can be, and calls her his
mistress”; and again, “My Lord to her is a very kind,
loving, and dear father, and in everything will I commend
him, saving only in this business of my land,
wherein I think some evil spirit works, for in this he
is as violent as possible, so I must either do it next
term or else break friendship and love with him”; and
Dorset was, on his side, of the same opinion, for in a
letter written to her at Knole, which begins “Sweet
Heart,” and sends messages to the child, he adds to his
wife, “whom in all things I love and hold a sober
woman, your land only excepted, which transports you
beyond yourself, and makes you devoid of all reason.”
It would appear that but for this unfortunate question
of the lands and money they might have lived happily
together, affection not lacking, and on Anne’s part at
any rate good will not lacking either, as witness her
constant defence of him, even to her mother:</p>

<p class='c019'>It is true that they have brought their matters so about
that I am in the greatest strait that ever poor creature was,
but whatsoever you may think of my Lord, I have found him,
do find him, and think I shall find him, the best and most
worthy man that ever breathed, therefore, if it be possible,
I beseech you, have a better opinion of him, if you know all
I do, I am sure you would believe this that I write, but I
durst not impart my mind about when I was with you,
because I found you so bitter against him, or else I could
have told you so many arguments of his goodness and worth
that you should have seen it plainly yourself.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>They were married when she was nineteen and he
was twenty, and two days after their marriage he
succeeded to his father’s titles and estates: “We have
no other news here but of weddings and burials, the
Earl of Dorset died on Monday night leaving a
heaire [?] widow God wot, and his son seeing him past
hope the Saturday before married the Lady Anne
Clifford.” In spite, however, of all they had to make
life pleasant—their youth, their wealth, and the
privileges of their position—they spent the succeeding
years in making it as unpleasant as they possibly could
for one another.</p>

<p class='c018'>I hardly think that it is necessary or even interesting
to go into the legal details of the long dispute over
Lord Cumberland’s will. The interest of Anne and
Richard Dorset is human, not litigious. It may therefore
be sufficient to say that by the terms of his will
Lord Cumberland bequeathed the vast Clifford estates
in Westmoreland to his brother Sir Francis Clifford,
with the proviso that they should revert to Anne, his
daughter, in the event of the failure of heirs male, a
reversion which eventually took place, thirty-eight
years after his death. What he does not appear to have
realized was that the estates were already entailed
upon Lady Anne; and that he was, by his will,
illegally breaking an entail which dated back to the
reign of Edward II.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is easy to judge, from this broad indication, the
infinite possibilities for litigation amongst persons contentiously
minded. Such persons were not lacking.
There was Lady Cumberland, Anne’s mother, bent
upon safeguarding the rights of her daughter. There
was Francis, the new Earl of Cumberland, equally
bent upon preserving what had been left to him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>will. There was Richard Dorset, whose own fortune
was not adequate to his extravagance, and who, having
married an heiress, was determined for his own sake
that that heiress should not be defrauded of her
inheritance, or that, if she was to be defrauded, he at
least should receive ample compensation. And finally
there was Anne herself, who was more resolved than
any of them that she and the North of England should
not be parted. Dorset’s part, of the four, was the most
elaborate and the most discreditable. He would have
been willing for his wife to renounce some of her claims
in return for the compromise of ready cash. Anne,
however, remained single-hearted throughout: she
was the legal heiress of the North, and the North she
would have; and in the midst of the otherwise sordid
and mercenary dispute, in which Dorset used every
means of coercion, she remains fixed in her perfectly
definite attitude of obstinacy, unswayed by her
husband, his relations, her own relations, their friends,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the King himself,
their remonstrances, their threats, their vindictiveness,
and the actual injuries she had to endure over a long
stretch of years. In the end she got the better of them
all, and the last picture of her left by the “Lives” is
that of a triumphant and imperious old lady, retired
to the stronghold of her northern castles, where her
authority could stand “against sectaries, almost against
Parliaments and armies themselves”; refusing to go
to court “unless she might wear blinkers”; moving
with feudal, with almost royal, state between her many
castles, from Appleby to Pendragon, from Pendragon
to Brougham, from Brougham to Brough, from
Brough to Skipton; building brew-houses, wash-houses,
bake-houses, kitchens, stables; sending word
to Cromwell that as fast as he should knock her castles
about her ears she would surely put them up again;
endowing almshouses; ruling over her almswomen
and her tenants; receiving, like the patriarchal old
despot that she was, the generations of her children, her
grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE CLIFFORD<br /><br /><span class='sc'>Wife to Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset</span><br /><br /><em>From the portrait at Knole by</em> <em>Mytens</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Before she could reach these serene waters, however,
she had many storms to weather, and to bear the
“crosses and contradictions” which caused her to
write “the marble pillars of Knole in Kent and Wilton
in Wiltshire were to me oftentimes but the gay arbours
of anguish.” Richard Sackville in his own day was a
byword for extravagance, and was bent on extorting
from his wife for the purposes of his own pleasure the
utmost resources of her inheritance. His portrait is at
Knole, a full-length by Van Somer; he has a pale,
pointed face, dark hair growing in a peak, and small
mean eyes, and is dressed entirely in black with
enormous silver rosettes on his shoes. There is also the
very beautiful miniature of him by Isaac Oliver in the
Victoria and Albert Museum, showing the richness of
his clothes, his embroidered stockings, and his hand
resting upon the extravagantly-plumed helmet on the
table beside him.</p>

<p class='c018'>His life is an empty record of gambling, cock-fighting,
tilting; of balls and masques, women and fine
clothes. “Above all they speak of the Earl of Dorset,”
says a contemporary letter, after describing the lavishness
of some of the costumes worn in a Court masque
in which he was taking part, “but their extreme cost
and riches make us all poor,” and Clarendon says of
him, “his excess of expenditure, in all the ways to
which money could be applied, was such that he so
entirely consumed almost the whole great fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>which descended to him, that when he was forced to
leave the title to his younger brother he left, in a
manner, nothing to him to support it.” The enormous
estates which he inherited, the careful accumulation of
the old Lord Treasurer, he sold in great part, in order
to squander the proceeds upon his amusements; before
he had been in possession for three years he had sold
the manor of Sevenoaks, and had “conveyed” Knole
itself to one Henry Smith (retaining, however, the
house at a rent of £100 a year for his own use), and in
the course of rather less than ten years he had sold
estates, including much of Fleet Street and the Manor
of Holborn, to the value of £80,616, or nearly a
million of modern money.</p>

<p class='c018'>In Aubrey’s <em>Bodleian Letters</em> there is an anecdote
concerning him, not devoid of humour:</p>

<p class='c019'>He [Sir Kenelm Digby] married that celebrated beauty
and courtesan, Mrs. Venetia Stanley, whom Richard, Earl
of Dorset, kept as his concubine, had children by her, and
settled on her an annuity of £500 per annum; which after
Sir Kenelm Digby married her was unpaid by the Earl: Sir
Kenelm Digby sued the Earl, after marriage, and recovered
it. Venetia Stanley was a most beautiful and desirable
creature&nbsp;... sanguine and tractable, and of much suavity.</p>

<p class='c019'>In those days Richard, Earl of Dorset, lived in the greatest
splendour of any nobleman of England.</p>

<p class='c019'>After her marriage she [Venetia Stanley] redeemed her
honour by her strict living. Once a year the Earl of Dorset
invited her and Sir Kenelm to dinner, where the Earl would
behold her with much passion, yet only kiss her hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Later on in his life a certain Lady Peneystone
appears, who considerably complicated the already
difficult relations between Anne and himself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Anne Clifford herself, in spite of all that she had to
endure at his hands, gives a charitable account of him.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>This first lord of mine was in his own nature of a just mind,
of a sweet disposition, and very valiant in his own person.</p>

<p class='c019'>He was&nbsp;... so great a lover of scholars and soldiers, as
that with an excessive bounty towards them, or indeed any
of worth that were in distress, he did much to diminish his
estate, as also with excessive prodigality in housekeeping,
and other noble ways at court, as tilting, masqueing, and the
like, Prince Henry being then alive, who was much addicted
to these exercises, and of whom he was much beloved.</p>

<p class='c018'>What his wife says of his being a great lover of
scholars is borne out by his friendship with and
patronage of Beaumont, Ben Jonson, Fletcher, and
Drayton. Nothing else remains to his credit. He is
utterly eclipsed—weak, vain, and prodigal—by the
interest of that woman of character, his wife, knowing
so well to “discourse of all things, from predestination
to slea<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a> silk,” and by the faithful picture that is her
Diary.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c017'>She is living (1616) principally at Knole, sometimes
in London, sometimes making an expedition into the
North to join her mother, who in all her difficulties
was her counsellor and ally. The perpetual topic of the
diary is the dispute with her husband:</p>

<p class='c019'>“My Coz: Russell came to me the same day, and chid
me, and told me of all my faults and errors, he made me
weep bitterly, then I spoke a prayer of Owens, and came
home by water where I took an extreme Cold.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The Archbishop [of Canterbury] my Lord William
Howard, my Lord Rous, my Coz: Russell, my brother
Sackville, and a great company of men were all in the
gallery at Dorset House, where the Archbishop took me
aside and talked with me privately one hour and half, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>persuaded me both by Divine and human means to set my
hand to their arguments. But my answer to his Lordship
was that I would do nothing until my Lady [her mother] and
I had conferred together. Much persuasion was used by
him and all the company, sometimes terrifying me and sometimes
flattering me.</p>

<p class='c019'>Next day was a marvellous day to me, for it was generally
thought that I must either have sealed the argument or else
have parted from my Lord.</p>

<p class='c018'>She then starts for the North—a hazardous journey—to
confer with her mother.</p>

<p class='c019'>We had two coaches in our company with four horses
apiece and about twenty-six horsemen. I came to my lodgings
[at Derby] with a heavy heart considering how many things
stood between my Lord and I.</p>

<p class='c019'>We went from the Parsons’ House near the Dangerous
Moors, being eight miles and afterwards the ways so dangerous
the horses were fain to be taken out of the coach to be
lifted down the hills. This day Rivers’ horse fell from a bridge
into the river. We came to Manchester about ten at night.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dorset was not above subjecting her to petty annoyances
and humiliations, for he sends messengers after
her with “letters to show it was my Lord’s pleasure
that the men and horses should come away without
me, so after much falling out betwixt my Lady [her
mother] and them, all the folks went away, there being
a paper drawn to show that they went away by my
Lord’s direction and contrary to my will.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a> At night I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>sent two messengers to my folks to entreat them to
stay. For some two nights my mother and I lay
together, and had much talk about this business.”</p>

<p class='c018'>In order to get back to London she has to borrow
a coach from her mother, from whom she takes a
“grievous and heavy parting.” Arrived at Knole, “I
had a cold welcome from my Lord,” and a day or two
later he takes his departure for London, sending constant
messengers and letters, to know whether she will
give way to his demands. “About this time,” she
sadly writes—it is April, spring at Knole, and she then
aged twenty-six—“about this time I used to rise early
in the morning and go to the Standing in the garden,
and taking my prayer book with me beseech God to be
merciful to me and to help me as He always hath done.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile Dorset’s threats increase in virulence:
on the first of May he sends Mr. Rivers to tell her she
shall live neither at Knole nor at Bolbrook; on the
second he sends Mr. Legg to tell the servants he will
come down once more to see her, which shall be the
last time; and on the third he sends Peter Basket, his
gentleman of the horse, with a letter to say “it was his
pleasure that the Child should go the next day to
London&nbsp;... when I considered that it would both
make my Lord more angry with me and be worse for
the Child I resolved to let her go; after I had sent
for Mr. Legg and talked with him about that and other
matters I wept bitterly.”</p>

<p class='c018'>On the fourth “... the Child went into the
litter to go to London.” There is no comment. It
must have been a pathetic little departure.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the ninth she received, besides the news that her
mother was dangerously ill, “a letter from my Lord
to let me know his determination was the Child should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>go to live at Horsley, and not come hither any more,
so as this was a very grievous and sorrowful day to me.”
An unusual bitterness escapes from her pen:</p>

<p class='c019'>All this time my Lord was in London where he had all
and infinite great resort coming to him. He went much
abroad to Cocking and Bowling Alleys, to plays and horse
races, and commended by all the world. I stayed in the
country, having many times a sorrowful and heavy heart, and
being condemned by most folks because I would not consent
to the agreement, so as I may truly say I am like an owl in
the desert.</p>

<p class='c018'>And a few days later:</p>

<p class='c019'>My Lord came down from London, my Lord lying in
Leslie Chamber and I in my own. My Lord and I after
supper had some talk, we fell out and parted for that night.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was worse to come, for at the end of the month
her mother died, “which I held as the greatest and
most lamentable cross that could have befallen me,”
and, mixed up with this sorrow, which is evidently
genuine, is the fear that she may be definitely dispossessed
of the inheritance of her forefathers. She
found, however, that she had the disposal of the body,
“which was some contentment to my aggrieved soul.”
Her sorrows begin to lighten. Dorset, probably perceiving
his bullying to be worse than useless against a
woman of her mettle, tries a different tack: “My
Lord assured me how kind and good a husband he
would be to me”; they patch up a reconciliation, and
she makes over to him certain of her Cumberland
estates in default of heirs; they agree that Mrs.
Bathurst, apparently a bone of contention, should “go
away from the Child&nbsp;... so that my Lord and I were
never greater friends than at this time&nbsp;... and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Lord brought me down to the coach side where we had
a loving and kind parting.” He even joined her in the
North, and she records how at Appleby Castle she set
up the “green velvet bed where the same night we
went to lie there,” and how “in the afternoon I
wrought stitchwork and my Lord sat and read by me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She gives many particulars of how she spent her days
in the North. I fancy she was a good deal happier there,
and more at home, and consequently more lighthearted,
than at Knole. At the same time she was
anxious to go back to London to rejoin Dorset, but
this for some reason he was not disposed to allow. She
consoled herself with innocuous occupations:</p>

<p class='c019'>This month I spent in working and reading. Mr.
Dunbell read a great part of the <cite>History of the Netherlands</cite>....
Upon the 1st I rose by times in the morning and went
up to the Pagan Tower to my prayers, and saw the sun rise....
Upon the 4th I sat in the Drawing Chamber all the
day at my work.... Upon the 9th I sat at my work and
heard Rivers and Marsh read Montaigne’s <cite>Essays</cite>, which
book they have read almost this fortnight.... Upon the
12th I made an end of my cushion of Irish stitch, it being
my chief help to pass away the time at work.... Upon the
21st was the first day I put on my black silk grogram gown....
Upon the 20th I spent most of the day in playing at
Tables. All this time since my Lord went away I wore my
black Taffety night-gown<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c020'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and a yellow Taffety waistcoat and
used to rise betimes in the morning and walk upon the leads
and afterwards to hear reading. Upon the 23rd I did string
the pearls and diamonds left me by my mother into a necklace.</p>

<p class='c018'>At last the summons came, and “upon the 24th
Basket set out from London to Brougham Castle to
fetch me up. I bought of Mr. Cleborn who came to see
me a clock and a save-Guard [= cloak] of cloth laced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>with black lace to keep me warm on my journey.”
Dorset sent in the retinue to fetch her, moreover, a
cook, a baker, and a Tom Fool.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her arrival in London was auspicious: Dorset and
a company of relatives came out to meet her at
Islington, so that there were in all ten or eleven coaches,
and when she arrived at Dorset House she found the
house “well dressed up against I came,” and the Child
met her in the gallery. Moreover, “all this time of my
being at London I was much sent to and visited by
many” (the young heiress, whose matrimonial disputes
had raised so much dust at Court, was an object
of interest and curiosity), and she made friends: “My
Lady Manners came in the morning to dress my head.
I had a new black wrought Taffety gown which my
Lady St. John’s tailor made. She used often to come
to me, and I to her, and was very kind one to another.”
Such troubles as she had were but slight: “I dined
above in my chamber and wore my night-gown
because I was not very well, which day and yesterday
I forgot that it was fish day and ate flesh at both
dinners. In the afternoon I played at Glecko<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c020'><sup>[5]</sup></a> with
my Lady Gray and lost £27 odd money.” So far, so
good. She gave a sweet-bag to the Queen for a New
Year’s gift, and was kissed by the King. She went to
see the play of the Mad Lover; she went to the Tower
to see Lord and Lady Somerset, lying there since their
arraignment; she went to the Court to see Lord
Villiers created Earl of Buckingham; she ate a
“scrambling supper” and went to see the Masque on
Twelfth Night. She betrays with an unsophisticated
and rather charming ingenuity her delight in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>things. But the storm scowled at her over the rim of the
horizon, and presently it broke. The first entries are
like the splash of the first big rain-drops: “We came
from London to Knole; this night my Lord and I had
a falling out about the land.” Next day she has Mr.
Sandy’s book about the government of the Turks read
aloud to her, but “my Lord sat the most part of the
day reading in his closet.” Next day his sulks
materialized, and he “went up to London upon the
sudden, we not knowing it till the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Six days later—there are no entries in the diary to
record the suspense of these six days—she is sent for to
London to see the King, a higher test for her strength
of mind, even, than the former persuasions of the Archbishop
of Canterbury. Will she capitulate at last? or
will she come out with her flag still flying? the
tongues of London wagged. The interview is best
given in her own words:</p>

<p class='c019'>Upon the 17th when I came up, my Lord told me I must
resolve to go to the King next day. Upon the 18th being
Saturday, I went presently after dinner to the Queen to the
Drawing Chamber where my Lady Derby told the Queen
how my business stood, and that I was to go to the King,
so she promised me she would do all the good in it she could.
When I had stayed but a little while there I was sent for out,
my Lord and I going through my Lord Buckingham’s
chamber, who brought us into the King, being in the
Drawing Chamber. He put out all those that were there, and
my Lord and I kneeled by his chair side, when he persuaded
us both to peace and to put the whole matter wholly into his
hands, which my Lord consented to, but I beseeched His
Majesty to pardon me <em>for that I would never part from Westmoreland
while I lived upon any condition whatsoever</em>, sometimes
he used fair means and persuasions and sometimes foul
means, but I was resolved before, so, as nothing would move
me, from the King we went to the Queen’s side, and brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>my Lady St. John to her lodging and so we went
home.</p>

<p class='c018'>There is a little note at the side of this entry: “The
Queen gave me warning not to trust my matters absolutely
to the King lest he should deceive me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The affair was not allowed to rest there. Two days
later she was again summoned before the King, and a
sour, unedifying spectacle the majesty of James I must
have presented, thus confronted with the young
obstinacy of the heiress of Westmoreland:</p>

<p class='c019'>I was sent for up to the King into his Drawing Chamber,
where the door was locked and nobody suffered to stay here
but my Lord and I, my Uncle Cumberland, my Coz:
Clifford, my Lords Arundel, Pembroke and Montgomery,
Sir John Digby. For lawyers there were my Lord Chief
Justice Montague, and Hobart Yelverton the King’s
Solicitor, Sir Randal Crewe that was to speak for my Lord
and I. The King asked us all if we would submit to his
judgement in this case, my uncle Cumberland, my Coz:
Clifford, and my Lord answered they would, but I would
never agree to it without Westmoreland, at which the King
grew in a great chaff. My Lord of Pembroke and the King’s
solicitor speaking much against me, at last when they saw
there was no remedy, my Lord, fearing the King would do
me some public disgrace, desired Sir John Digby would open
the door, who went out with me and persuaded me much to
yield to the King. Presently after my Lord came from the
King, when it was resolved that if I would not come to an
agreement there should be an agreement made without me.</p>

<p class='c018'>After these encounters she retired to Knole, while
Dorset remained in London, “being in extraordinary
grace and favour with the King.” She, poor thing,
resumed at Knole the pitiful monotony of her country
existence, which to a mind so vigorous must have been
irksome in the extreme, and the Diary becomes again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the record of her small occupations threaded with the
worry and sorrow of her dissensions with her husband.
It is illuminating that she never criticizes him; there
are references to his “worth and nobleness of disposition”;
her spirit, although high and emancipated
enough to stand out against the King in the defence of
Westmoreland, could not conceive revolt against the
subjection of matrimony. It is an idea which never
once enters her head. She even writes him a letter to
give him “humble thanks for his noble usage toward
me in London”; but a very little while after this
“Thomas Woodgate came from London and brought
a squirrel to the Child, and my Lord wrote me a letter
by which I perceived my Lord was clean out with me,
and how much my enemies have wrought against me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Conscientious as she is, she no longer finds enough
events to justify a daily entry. Perhaps—who knows?
for my part I strongly suspect it—her fighting spirit
preferred even the ordeals and excitements of London
to the tedium of Knole. She has very little to tell:
only the gowns she wore, the books she read, the games
she played with the steward, and the ailments of the
Child.</p>

<p class='c019'>At this time I wore a plain green flannel gown that
William Pinn made me and my yellow taffety waistcoat.
Rivers used to read to me in Montaigne’s <cite>Essays</cite>, and Moll
Neville in the <cite>Fairy Queen</cite>. The Child had a bitter fit of
her ague again insomuch I was fearful of her that I could
hardly sleep all night and I beseeched God Almighty to be
merciful and spare her life.</p>

<p class='c018'>This ague of the Child’s is a constant preoccupation.
I suppose that it was a kind of convulsion, for which
the cure was a “salt powder to put in her beer.” On
certain days a return of it appears to have been confidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>expected, for I find: “upon the 4th should
have been the Child’s fit, but she missed it,” and two
days later she has “a grudging of her ague.” There is
a good deal about the Child—never referred to under
any other designation until she attains her 5th birthday,
after which she is promoted to “my Lady
Margaret.” The portrait of her which is here reproduced
hangs over the fireplace in Lady Betty Germaine’s
sitting-room; her ring dangles on a ribbon
round her neck, and her hair is done in an elaborate
manner which defied all my efforts, when I was the
same age, to do my own in the same way.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was an amusement and a consolation, as well as
a source of anxiety, to her mother. Her garments are
carefully noted:</p>

<p class='c019'>The 28th was the first time the Child put on a pair of
whalebone bodice.... The Child put on her red bays
coat.... I cut the Child’s strings from off her coats and
made her use togs alone, so as she had two or three falls at
first but had no hurt with them.... The Child put on her
first coats that were laced, with lace being of red bays....
I began to dress my head with a roll without a wire. I wrote
not to my Lord because he wrote not to me since he went
away. After supper I went out with the child who rode a
pie-bald nag. The 14th, the Child came to lie with me which
was the first time that ever she lay all night in a bed with
me since she was born;</p>
<p class='c025'>and another time she speaks of “the time being very
tedious with me, as having neither comfort nor company,
only the Child.”</p>

<p class='c018'>For the rest, she was thrown back upon her own
resources. Dorset came and went, and in between
whiles there are small, vivid pictures of existence at
Knole:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>After supper I walked in the garden and gathered cherries,
and talked with Josiah [the French page] who told me he
thought all the men in the house loved me.</p>

<p class='c018'>And again:</p>

<p class='c019'>About this time [April 1617] my Lord made the steward
alter most of the rooms in the house and dress them up as
fine as he could and determined to make all his old clothes
in purple stuff for the Gallery and Drawing Chamber.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>March 1617. 5th.</em> Couch puppied in the morning.</p>

<p class='c019'><cite>8th.</cite> I made an end of reading <cite>Exodus</cite>. After supper I
played at Glecko with the steward as I often do after dinner
and supper.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>9th.</em> I went abroad in the garden and said my prayers in
the standing.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>10th.</em> I was not well at night, so I ate a posset and went to
bed.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>11th.</em> The time grew tedious, so as I used to go to bed
about 8 o’clock I did lie a-bed till 8 the next morning.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>14th.</em> I made an end of my Irish stitch cushion.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>15th.</em> My Lord came down to Buckhurst. This day I put
on my mourning grogram gown and intend to wear it till
my mourning time is out, because I was found fault with for
wearing such ill clothes.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>22nd.</em> I began a new Irish stitch cushion.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>24th.</em> We made Rosemary cakes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Two days later Dorset arrived from Buckhurst, and
they walked together in the park and the garden.
“I wrought much within doors and strived to sit as
merry a face as I could upon a discontented heart”;
but in spite of this entry they seem to have remained
on fairly friendly terms until Easter.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>30th.</em> I spent in walking and sitting in the park, having
my mind more contented than it was before my Lord came
from Buckhurst.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>5th April.</em> My Lord went up to my closet and said how
little money I had left contrary to all they had told him,
sometimes I had fair words from him and sometimes foul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>but I took all patiently, and did strive to give him as much
content and assurance of my love as I could possibly, yet
<em>I told him I would never part with Westmoreland</em>. After
supper, because my Lord was sullen and not willing to go
into the nursery, I had Mary bring the Child to him in my
chamber.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>7th.</em> My Lord lay in my chamber.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>13th.</em> My Lord supped privately with me in the Drawing
Chamber, and had much discourse of the manners of the
folks at court.</p>

<p class='c019'>By the <em>17th</em>, My Lord told me he was resolved never to
move me more in these business because he saw how fully
I was bent;</p>

<p class='c018'>but evidently he did not stick to this good resolution,
because, on April 20th, Easter-day, “My Lord and
I had a great falling-out,” and a few days later, “This
night my Lord should have lain with me, but he and
I fell out about matters.”</p>

<p class='c018'>By the next day, however, they were friends again;
they played at Burley Break upon the lawn; and
“this night my Lord came to lie in my chamber.”
The next day, too, was spent in peace, and she “spent
the evening in working and going down to my Lord’s
closet, where I sat and read much in the Turkish
history, and Chaucer.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So it goes on. It becomes, perhaps, a little monotonous,
save that it is always so human, and so modern.
One sympathizes with her in her weaknesses even
more than in her defiance; when, for instance, she
writes amicable letters to all her relations-in-law, sending
them locks of the Child’s hair, being “desirous to
win the love of my Lord’s kindred by all the fair means
I could,” in reality stealing a march upon Dorset in
order to get them on her side. One day she chronicles,
“This night I went into a bath,” but whether this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>event was of such rarity as to deserve special mention is
not explained. At Whitsuntide they all went to church,
but “my eyes were so blubbered with weeping that
I could scarce look up,” and in the afternoon of the
same day they again “fell out.” But she consoles herself
with new clothes—or was that an additional
penance? for she was never given to personal vanity—“I
essayed on my sea-water green satin gown and my
damask embroidered with gold, both which gowns the
tailor which was sent from London made fit for me to
wear with open ruffs after the French fashion.” Little
peace-offerings came from time to time from Dorset;
on one occasion he sends “half a buck, with an
indifferent kind letter,” and on another occasion “My
Lord sent Adam to trim the Child’s hair, and sent me
the dewselts of two deer and wrote me a letter between
kindness and unkindness.” “Still working and being
extremely melancholy” is the entry of one summer
day, and a day later, “Still working and sad.” A
little after this she “rode on horseback to Withyham
to see my Lord Treasurer’s tomb, and went down into
the vault, and came home again [to Knole] weeping
the most part of the day.” This is perhaps not very
surprising. I have been down into that vault myself,
and it is not a cheerful expedition. In a small, dark cave
underground, beneath the church, among grey veils
of cobwebs, the coffins of the Sackvilles are stacked on
shelves; they go back to the fourteenth century, and
are of all sizes, from full-grown men down to the tiny
ones lapped in lead. But, of course, when Anne
Clifford went there there were not so many as there
are now; the pompous ones were not yet in their
places, with their rusty coronets, save those of the old
Treasurer and his son; and their blood did not run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in the veins of Lady Anne, so on the whole she had
less reason to be impressed than I.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Diary continues in very much the same strain
until it comes to an end with December 1619, the year
1618 being entirely missed out. By that time both
Dorset and Anne were in bad health; but whereas he
was to die five years later, at the age of thirty-five,
she, made of tougher stuff, was to survive him by
fifty-two years. His last letter to her, written to her
on the very day of his death, shows all the affection
which was so undermined by that question of her
lands:</p>

<p class='c018'>“His debts,” says one Chamberlain, writing to Sir
Dudley Carleton, “are £60,000, so that he does not
leave much.” In his will he bequeaths to his “dearly
beloved wife all her wearing apparel and such rings and
jewels as were hers on her marriage, and the rock ruby
ring which I have given her,” also “my carriage
made by Mefflyn, lined with green cloth and laced
with green and black silk lace, and my six bay coach
geldings.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Her portraits change as her years advance, and the
lines of determination harden about her mouth. Her
true life—the life for which she was most truly fitted—only
began after she had passed her fiftieth year, when
with the death of her kinsman Lord Cumberland the
northern estates passed calmly and naturally into her
hands at last. All the quarrels and litigation and
anxiety of her youth were left behind her; she had
buried Lord Dorset; she had buried Lord Pembroke
after a second marriage as disastrous and as contentious
as the first; she had borne Sackville children and
Herbert children; she had been long-suffering though
adamant, submissive though immovable; she had
moped in the sumptuous prisons that were Knole and
Wilton; now she was free to turn tyrant herself over
her own undisputed realm. She wasted nothing of the
opportunity. Away from London, away from the
influence of the Court, entrenched in her numerous
castles in the North, she ruled autocratically over her
servants, her tenants, her neighbours, and the generations
and ramifications of her family. No detail of
comings and goings, no penny of expenditure escaped
her vigilant eye or her recording pen; and her diary,
that document of intimacy, autocracy, piety, and
exactitude, carries its entries down to the very day
before her death. With public or political events she
scarcely ever concerned herself, but on the other hand
no detail of her own private life or of the existence of
those around her was too small to excite her comment.
Whether her laundry-maids went to church, whether
she pared her finger and toe nails, whether her dog
puppied, whether she received letters, whether she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>washed her feet and legs (this is on the 22nd of
February, the last occasion being on the 13th of
December preceding), whether she kissed the sempstress—all
is noted with the same precision and gravity.
No anniversary or coincidence is allowed to pass
unobserved. That amazing memory extended back
over threescore years; and, moreover, she had the
immense volumes of her notebooks for reference, date
for date. Her past was ever present to her, the agreeable
and the disagreeable merged into one landscape of
consonant tone, and whether she observes that this day
sixty years ago she travelled with her blessed mother,
or fell out with Dorset, it is with the same complacency
and satisfaction at having the tiny anniversary to
record. This vigorous mind was not, perhaps, planned
on a very broad scale. It was self-centred and self-sufficient;
severe but not reckless; no fine carelessness
endears her to us, or surprises; even her acts
of generosity, and they were numerous, are recorded
with the same scrupulous accuracy. She could not give
two shillings to a child without setting it down. Her
generosity, like all her other acts, was methodical; she
rewarded her servants for definite services with extra
wages; she kept ready to hand a supply of little
presents, because it was contrary to her ideas of
hospitality that any visitor, however humble, should
go away empty-handed, and was careful to consider
what particular gift would be most acceptable to the
recipient, frequently choosing something of practical
utility, such as gloves or lengths of cloth for women,
money or ruffles for men; and these idiosyncracies
run true all through her character, for, conversely,
although she was prepared to be generous in her treatment
of others, she was equally determined that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>herself should be fairly treated by them, and frequent
are the entries in her diary to this effect: “In the
morning did I see Mr. Robert Willison of Penrith paid
for a rundlet of sack, but I was very angry with him
because I thought it too dear, and told him I would
have no more of him, and then he slipped away from
me in a good hurry.” She would always pay cash too,
and bullied her special almswomen, whom she would
not allow to ask for credit with the tradesmen of
Appleby.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her rights were her rights, and she had always had a
great idea of them. One recognizes the spirit that told
the King she “<em>would never be parted from Westmoreland</em>,”
in the old litigant that went unhesitatingly
and repeatedly to law over niceties connected with
small portions of her estates, content to spend large
sums of money in lawyers’ fees if only she could
succeed—as she invariably did—in proving her point.
There is one story which illustrates both her tenacity
and her humour—the story of a certain tenant whose
rent included a hen due yearly to the lady of the
manor. This tribute he neglected to hand over. Lady
Anne instantly had the law on him, spent £400 in
enforcing her claim, won her case, received the hen,
invited her defeated opponent to dinner with her, and
caused the bird to be cooked for them both as the
staple dish of the meal.</p>

<p class='c018'>So the tranquil and crowded years spun themselves
out for her, and she grew to be an old woman and a
contented one, for she had attained at last the existence
and occupations best suited to her. Her life was full:
the things which filled it were small things, perhaps,
but if they satisfied her who should cavil? Her
journeyings alone occupied much of her time: those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>extraordinary progresses from castle to castle, she herself
travelling in her horse-litter, her ladies in the
coach-and-six, her menservants on horseback, her
women in other coaches, and a rabble of small fry
following, so that the miniature army which accompanied
her amounted sometimes to as many as three
hundred. Often this retinue would include members
of her family, or some of her neighbours; they
travelled over the moors of the North, by rough roads,
“uncouth and untrodden, those mountainous and
almost impassable ways,” stopping on the way in those
highland villages which had not yet been honoured by
a visit from the great old lady or received her bounty,
and, coming at the end of the journey to Brougham,
to Brough, to Barden, to Skipton, to Pendragon, or to
Appleby, Lady Anne would receive her dependants
one by one in her own chamber, give her hand to the
men, kiss the women, and dismiss them again to their
own homes. Her health was no longer very good, but
that was never allowed to deter her from her plans:
her courage and vigour triumphed always over the
treacherous flesh, greatly to the concern of those about
her. On one occasion, travelling from Appleby to
Brougham, she was delayed at the start by a “swounding
fit,” when she had to be carried to a bed and laid
there near a “great fire”; much persuasion was used
that she “would not travel on so sharp and cold a day,
but she, having before fixed on that day, and so much
company being come purposely to wait on her, she
would go.” As she reached her litter, however, she
fainted again, “Yet as soon as that fit was over she
went.” Arrived at Brougham she fainted for the third
time, but on being upbraided by her friends and
servants for her stubbornness in making the journey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>she replied that she knew she must die, and it was the
same thing to her to die on the way as in her house,
in her litter or in her bed, and furthermore would not
acknowledge any necessity why she should live, but
saw every necessity for keeping to her resolution. “If
she will, she will, you may depend on’t,” they said of
her, “if she won’t, she won’t, and there’s an end on’t.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Now that there was no one to reproach her, as
Dorset had been accustomed to reproach her, for her
lack of finery and absence of proper vanity, she dressed
always in rough black serge, she shaved her head, her
fare was of the plainest, and her personal economy was
pushed to the length of such small eccentricities as
using up every stray scrap of paper for her correspondence.
One luxury, indeed, she permitted herself:
she smoked a pipe. Into all the details of her household
she looked with a careful eye; already in the days
when she was living at Knole she had used up Richard
Dorset’s old shirts to make clouts, now at Appleby
she saw to the preserving of fruit, she had her cheeses
made at Brougham, sixteen at a time, she got her coal
from her own pits, she had all delinquents into her own
room and scolded them till they were probably thankful
to be dismissed. At the same time she never forgot
those that had served her faithfully; she would send
her own coach to bring some old retainer to visit her;
the marriages, morals, and vicissitudes of her meanest
servant were a matter of interest to her; their marriage
portions she made her own affair. Besides her servants,
her own family gave her much food for thought and
preoccupation: it is true that of her seven children
only two—her two Sackville daughters—had lived to
grow up, but they by now had produced a cohort of
grandchildren, whose visits to Lady Anne were a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>source of infinite pleasure to the old lady. It is, altogether,
a pleasant and seemly end to such a life. She
had attained the great age of eighty-six; her diary
was filled with religious references; she never dwelt
upon her death, but it is clear that she can never for
one moment have dreaded it. She had lived up consistently
to her principles and to her motto: “Preserve
your loyalty, defend your rights,” and was ready
to go whenever the call should come. “I went not out
all this day,” is the last entry in her diary, and the next
day (22nd of March 1676), there is an entry in
another hand, “The 22nd day the Countess died.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> Knole in the Reign of Charles I<br /> EDWARD SACKVILLE<br /> <span class='large'>4th<br /> Earl <em>of</em> Dorset</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The wreckage of Richard’s estates devolved at
his death upon his brother Edward, who at that
time was travelling in Italy. This Edward
Sackville was once to me the embodiment of Cavalier
romance. At the age of thirteen I wrote an enormous
novel about him and his two sons. He had the advantage
of starting with Vandyck’s portrait in the hall,
the flame-coloured doublet, the blue Garter, the
characteristic swaggering attitude, the sword, the lovelocks,
the key of office painted dangling from his hip
and the actual key dangling on a ribbon from the
frame of the picture—and then the account of his duel
with Lord Bruce, his devotion to Charles I, the
plundering raid of Cromwell’s soldiers into Knole, the
murder of his younger son by the Roundheads, the
picture of the two boys throwing dice—all this was a
source of rich romance to a youthful imagination
nourished on <cite>Cyrano</cite> and <cite>The Three Musketeers</cite>. I
used to steal up to the attics to examine the old nail-studded
trunks from which the Roundheads had
broken off the locks. There they were—the visible
evidence of the old paper in the Muniment Room,
which said, “They have broken open six trunks; in
one of them was money; what is lost of it we know not,
in regard the keeper of it is from home.” There they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>were, carelessly stacked: on one of them was stabbed
the date in big nails, 1623; and there were others,
curved to fit the roof of a barouche; of later date these,
but all intimate and palpitating to a very ignorant
child to whom the centuries meant Thomas or Richard
or Edward Sackville; Holbein, Vandyck or Reynolds;
farthingale chairs or love-seats. What were dates when
the centuries went by generations? The battered
trunks were stacked near the entrance to the hiding-place,
which, without the smallest justification save an
old candlestick and a rope-ladder found therein, I
peopled with the fugitive figures of priests and
Royalists. I peeped into the trunks: they contained
only a dusty jumble of broken ironwork, some old
books, some bits of hairy plaster fallen from the ceiling,
some numbers of <cite>Punch</cite> for 1850. Nevertheless, there
were the gaping holes where the locks had been prised
off the trunks, and the lid forced back upon the hinges
by an impatient hand. Down in the Poets’ Parlour,
where I lunched with my grandfather, taciturn unless
he happened to crack one of his little stock-in-trade of
jokes, Cromwell’s soldiers had held their Court of
Sequestration. The Guard Room was empty of arms
or armour, save for a few pikes and halberds, because
Cromwell’s soldiers had taken all the armour away.
The past mingled with the present in constant
reminder; and out in the summer-house, after
luncheon, with the bees blundering among the flowers
of the Sunk Garden and the dragon-flies flashing over
the pond, I returned to the immense ledger in which
I was writing my novel, while Grandpapa retired to
his little sitting-room and whittled paper-knives from
the lids of cigar-boxes, and thought about—Heaven
knows what <em>he</em> thought about.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Edward Sackville in the big Vandyck was indeed a
handsome, rubicund figure, “beautiful, graceful, and
vigorous&nbsp;... the vices he had were of the age, which
he was not stubborn enough to resist or to condemn.”
What these vices were I do not know; the records of
his life make no allusion to them. It is true that the
cause of his duel remains a mystery; Lord Clarendon
knew it, but beyond mentioning that it was fought on
account of a lady, kept his own counsel. It is true also
that his sister-in-law, Lady Anne Clifford, disliked him
greatly and spoke of the malice he had always shown
towards her; but then amicable relationship with Lady
Anne was not easily sustained. On the face of it, his life
seems to have been loyal and honourable: he suffered
considerably for the sake of the cause he had at heart,
and his few speeches and letters are full of reserve and
dignity, supported by the facts of his own misfortunes;
I do not see what more he could have done to deserve
the adjective staunch. To me at thirteen he was very
staunch and doughty, and one does not willingly go
back on one’s first impressions. His wife, too, in the
pointed stomacher, and the shoes with huge rosettes,
governess to the royal children, voted a public funeral
in Westminster Abbey, was another staunch figure:
severe, uncompromising, but impeccable.</p>

<p class='c018'>The duel with Lord Bruce was fought when Edward
Sackville was twenty-three years old, at Bergen-op-Zoom
in Holland, which so late as 1814 still went by
the name of Bruceland. In the Knole Muniment
room a paper cover was found upon which was
written “The relation of my Lord’s duel with
the Lord Bruce,” and the following are in all
probability the papers originally contained therein.
The “Worthy sir” to whom the letter is addressed
remains anonymous, but was evidently some friend
in England:</p>

<p class='c019'>As I am not ignorant, so I ought to be sensible of the
false aspersions some authorless tongues have laid upon
me in the reports of the unfortunate passage lately happened
between the Lord Bruce and myself, which, as they
are spread here, so I may justly fear they reign also where you
are. There are but two ways to resolve doubts of this nature,
by oath and by sword.</p>

<p class='c019'>The first is due to magistrates, and communicable to
friends; the other to such as maliciously slander, and
impudently defend their assertions. Your love, not my
merit, assures me you hold me your friend; which esteem
I am much desirous to retain. Do me, therefore, the right
to understand the truth of that; and, in my behalf, inform
others, who either are or may be infected with sinister
rumours, much prejudicial to that fair opinion I desire to
hold amongst all worthy persons; and, on the faith of a
gentleman, the relation I shall give is neither more nor less
than the bare truth. The enclosed contains the first citation
sent me from Paris by a Scottish gentleman, who delivered
it me in Derbyshire, at my father-in-law’s house. After it
follows my then answer, returned him by the same bearer.
The next is my accomplishment of my first promise, being
a particular assignation of place and weapon, which I sent
by a servant of mine, by post, from Rotterdam, as soon as I
landed there, the receipt of which, joined with an acknowledgement
of my fair carriage to the deceased Lord, is
testified by the last, which periods the business till we met at
Tergose, in Zealand, it being the place allotted for rendezvous;
where he [accompanied with one Mr. Crawford, an
English gentleman, for his second, a surgeon, and his man]
arrived with all the speed he could. And there having
rendered himself, I addressed my second, Sir John Heydon,
to let him understand that now all following should be done
by consent, as concerning the terms whereon we should fight,
as also the place. To our seconds we gave power for their
appointments, who agreed that we should go to Antwerp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>from thence to Bergen-op-Zoom, where in the midway a
village divides the States’ territories from the Archduke’s;
and there was the destined stage, to the end, that, having
ended, he that could might presently exempt himself from
the justice of the country, by retiring into the dominion not
offended. It was further concluded, that in case any should
fall or slip, that then the combat should cease; and he,
whose ill fortune had so subjected him, was to acknowledge
his life to have been in the other’s hands. But in case one
party’s sword should break, because that could only chance
by hazard, it was agreed that the other should take no
advantage, but either then be made friends, or else, upon
even terms, go to it again. Thus these conclusions, being
by each of them related to his party, were, by us, both
approved and assented to. Accordingly we embarked for
Antwerp; and by reason my Lord [as I conceive, because
he could not handsomely without danger of discovery] had
not paired the sword I sent him to Paris, bringing one of the
same length, but twice as broad, my second excepted against
it, and advised me to match my own, and send him the
choice; which I obeyed, it being, you know, the challenger’s
privilege to elect his weapon. At the delivery of the swords,
which was performed by Sir John Heydon, it pleased the
Lord Bruce to choose my own; and then, past expectation,
he told him that he found himself so far behind-hand, as a
little of my blood would not serve his turn; and therefore
he was now resolved to have me alone, because he knew [for
I will use his own words] that so worthy a gentleman, and
my friend, could not endure to stand by, and see him do that
which he must, to satisfy himself and his honour. Thereunto
Sir John Heydon replied, that such intentions were
bloody and butcherly, far unfitting so noble a personage,
who should desire to bleed for reputation, not for life;
withal adding, he thought himself injured, being come thus
far, now to be prohibited from executing those honourable
offices he came for. The Lord Bruce, for answer, only
reiterated his former resolution; the which, not for matter,
but for manner, so moved me, as though to my remembrance
I had not for a long while eaten more liberally than at
dinner; and therefore, unfit for such an action [seeing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>surgeons hold a wound upon a full stomach much more
dangerous than otherwise], I requested my second to certify
him I would presently decide the difference, and should
therefore meet him, on horseback, only waited on by our
surgeons, they being unarmed. Together we rode [but one
before the other some twelve score] about two English
miles; and then Passion, having so weak an enemy to assail
as my direction, easily became victor; and, using his power,
made me obedient to his commands. I being very mad with
anger the Lord Bruce should thirst after my life with a kind
of assuredness, seeing I had come so far and needlessly to
give him leave to regain his lost reputation, I bade him
alight, which with all willingness he quickly granted; and
there, in a meadow [ankle-deep in the water at least],
bidding farewell to our doublets, in our shirts we began to
charge each other, having afore commanded our surgeons
to withdraw themselves a pretty distance from us; conjuring
them besides, as they respected our favour or their own
safeties, not to stir, but suffer us to execute our pleasure; we
being fully resolved [God forgive us] to despatch each other
by what means we could. I made a thrust at my enemy, but
was short; and, in drawing back my arm, I received a
great wound thereon, which I interpreted as a reward for my
short shooting; but, in revenge, I pressed in to him, though
I then missed him also; and then received a wound in my
right pap, which passed level through my body, and almost to
my back; and there we wrestled for the two greatest and dearest
prizes we could ever expect, trial for honour and life; in
which struggling, my hand, having but an ordinary glove on
it, lost one of her servants, though the meanest, which hung
by a skin, and, to sight, yet remaineth as before, and I am
put in hope one day to recover the use of it again. But at
last breathless, yet keeping our holds, there passed on both
sides propositions for quitting each other’s sword. But,
when Amity was dead, Confidence could not live, and who
should quit first was the question, which on neither part
either would perform; and, re-striving again afresh, with a
kick and a wrench together I freed my long-captive weapon,
which incontinently levying at his throat, being master still
of his, I demanded if he would ask his life or yield his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>sword? Both which, though in that imminent danger, he
bravely denied to do. Myself being wounded, and feeling
loss of blood, having three conduits running on me, began to
make me faint; and he courageously persisting not to accord
to either of my propositions, remembrance of his former
bloody desire, and feeling of my present estate, I struck at
his heart; but, with his avoiding, missed my aim, yet passed
through his body, and, drawing back my sword, repassed it
through again through another place, when he cried, “Oh,
I am slain!” seconding his speech with all the force he had
to cast me. But being too weak, after I had defended his
assault, I easily became master of him, laying him on his
back; when being upon him, I redemanded if he would
request his life? But it seems he prized it not at so dear a
rate to be beholden for it, bravely replying “He scorned it!”
which answer of his was so noble and worthy, as I protest
I could not find in my heart to offer him any more violence,
only keeping him down, till, at length, his surgeon afar off
cried out, “He would immediately die if his wounds were
not stopped!” whereupon I asked, “if he desired his
surgeon should come?” which he accepted of; and so being
drawn away, I never offered to take his sword, accounting
it inhumane to rob a dead man, for so I held him to be.
This thus ended, I retired to my surgeon, in whose arms,
after I had remained awhile for want of blood, I lost my sight,
and withal, as I then thought, my life also. But strong water
and his diligence quickly recovered me; when I escaped a
great danger, for my Lord’s surgeon, when nobody dreamt
of it, came full at me with his Lord’s sword; and had not
mine with my sword interposed himself, I had been slain
by those base hands, although my Lord Bruce, weltering in
his blood, and past all expectation of life, conformable to all
his former carriage, which was undoubtedly noble, cried out
“Rascal, hold thy hand!” So may I prosper, as I have
dealt sincerely with you in this relation, which I pray you,
with the enclosed letter, deliver to my Lord Chamberlain.
And so, etc.,</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c017'>Between this affair and the date of his succession to
his brother Richard, Edward Sackville was employed
on various missions: he sat in the House of Commons,
he was twice sent as ambassador to Louis XIII, and he
travelled in France and Italy. He was thus, when he
succeeded, an experienced man of thirty-four, and he
pursued, uninterruptedly, the sober path of office, now
Lord Chamberlain, now Lord Privy Seal, now a Commissioner
for planting Virginia, always in the confidence
of the King, and his name affixed to State
documents of the day in noble company. The disgraces
and follies of his predecessors and of his
descendants were not his lot, if that murderous duel is
to be excepted. My flaming Cavalier, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flamberge au
vent</span></i>, was in reality a sober and consistent gentleman;
loyal, but not impetuous; prejudiced, but not blinded;
devoted, but not afraid to speak his mind in criticism;
and in support of this claim I shall presently quote from
one of his speeches in which he argues against a continuance
of the Civil War and pleads for a prompt
reconciliation between the King and his Parliament.
His judgment is acute, and his attitude remarkably
sound and broad-minded. Yet at the same time his
devotion to the King was such, that after Charles’
execution Lord Dorset never passed beyond the
threshold of his own door.</p>

<p class='c018'>There are a few papers at Knole relating to the years
before the war began, and from them one may gather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>some idea of the then manner of life, always remembering
that Lord Dorset was much impoverished by the
extravagance of his brother. The total income for the
year 1628 from Knole and Sevenoaks was £100
18<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>—a fifth part of which was derived from the
sale of rabbits. Some details of expenses are given in the
account-books, besides those which I have already given
in connection with the park in the second chapter:</p>

<p class='c025'>That is to say, Dorset’s share would be £1268 7<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>,
or more than £10,000 of modern money.</p>

<p class='c018'>He obtained also £100 a year by devising to Richard
Gunnel and William Blagrave for four and a half years
a piece of land at the lower end of Salisbury Court,
Fleet Street, 140 feet in length and 42 feet in breadth,
on condition that they should at their own expense put
up a play-house.  What would be the rent of such a
piece of land now in Fleet Street? Certainly not
£100.</p>

<p class='c018'>In spite of the fact that he complained constantly of
his reduced income, Lord Dorset added considerably
to the park. He obtained a long lease of Seal Chart, and
“all woods and under-woods of the waste or common
of the Manors of Seal and Kemsing, viz., upon Rumshott
Common, Riverhill Common, Hubbard Hill
Common, and Westwood Common&nbsp;... in all at least
500 acres.”</p>

<p class='c018'>More entertaining is the acquisition of an overseas
estate—no less than that part of the east coast of
America which to-day includes New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia. Those little manors in the neighbourhood
of Sevenoaks, those 500 acres of common land,
dwindle suddenly beside this formidable tenure. “An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>island called Sandy [Hook]” the petition casually
begins:</p>

<p class='c019'>An island called Sandy, lying near the continent of
America, in the height of 44 degrees, was lately discovered by
one Rose, late master of a ship, who suffered shipwreck, and,
finding no inhabitants, took possession. The Earl of Dorset
prays a grant of the said island for thirty-one years, and that
none may adventure thither but such as petitioner shall license.</p>

<p class='c018'>A second petition takes one’s breath away with its
magnificent insolence:</p>

<p class='c019'>The Earl of Dorset to the King. Certain islands on the
south of New England, viz: Long Island, Cole Island,
Sandy Point, Hell Gates, Martin’s [? Martha’s] Vineyard,
Elizabeth Islands, Block Island, with other islands near
thereunto, were lately discovered by some of your Majesty’s
subjects and are not yet inhabited by Christians. Prays a
grant thereof with like powers of government as have been
granted for other plantations in America.</p>

<p class='c018'>Underneath this is scribbled:</p>

<p class='c019'>Reference to the Attorney-General to prepare a grant.
Whitehall, 20th Dec., 1637.</p>

<p class='c018'>One would wish to evoke for a brief hour the
spectres of those of his Majesty’s subjects who found
these localities uninhabited by Christians.</p>

<p class='c018'>Returning to Knole after this seems paltry; yet
even there Lord Dorset was conducting his affairs on
a proportionately large scale. He said himself that he
spent £40,000 after his son’s marriage, and one can
believe it when one reads a sample of the bill of fare
provided for a banquet. At the top is written:</p>

<p class='c019'>To perfume the room often in the meal with orange
flower water upon a hot pan. To have fresh bowls in every
corner and flowers tied upon them, and sweet briar, stock,
gilly-flowers, pinks, wallflowers and any other sweet flowers
in glasses and pots in every window and chimney.</p>

you a little while sometimes. I have played at cards 4 or 5
times this Christmas myself, after supper, which makes
me think I begin to turn gallant now. Some of my neighbours
put a compliment upon me this Christmas, and told
me the old Lady Cope would never be dead so long as I was
alive, they liked their entertainment so well, when my gilt
bowl went round amongst them, which saying pleased me
very well, for she was a discreet woman and worthy the
imitating. I am as well pleased to see my little man make
legs and dance a galliard, as if I had seen the mask at Court.
I am glad you got well home for we have had extreme ill
weather almost ever since you went, but now I will take the
benefit of this frost to go visit some of my neighbours on foot
to-morrow about seven miles off, but I will have a coach and
6 horses within a call, against I am weary. You know the
old saying, it is good going on foot with a horse in the hand.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>

<p class='c017'>On the approach of civil war there could be, of
course, no doubt on which side the Earl of Dorset
would range himself. He had been for many years
closely connected with both the King and Henrietta
Maria, and Lady Dorset stood in a yet more intimate
relationship to the King and Queen as governess to
their children. Since 1630, the date of the birth of
Charles II, she had held this position, and from this
little anecdote it may be judged that she was not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>severe a preceptress as her portrait might lead one to
suppose:</p>

<p class='c019'>Charles II, when a child, was weak in the legs, and ordered
to wear steel boots. Their weight so annoyed him that he
pined till recreation became labour—an old Rocker took off
the steel boots and concealed them: promising the Countess
of Dorset, who was Charles’ governess, that he would take
any blame for the act on himself. Soon afterwards, the King,
Charles I, coming into the nursery, and seeing the boy’s
legs without the boots, angrily demanded who had done it.
“It was I, Sir,” said the Rocker, “who had the honour some
thirty years since to attend on your Highness in your infancy,
when you had the same infirmity wherewith now the Prince,
your very own son, is troubled—and then the Lady Cary,
afterwards Countess of Monmouth, commanded your steel
boots to be taken off, who, blessed be God, since have
gathered strength and arrived at a good stature.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It is no small tribute to Lady Dorset’s integrity that
after the outbreak of war she should have been continued
in her office by Parliament.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have in my own possession a receipt signed by her
for £125 for salary and expenses, 1641.</p>

<p class='c018'>War became imminent:</p>

<p class='c021'>“the citizens grow very tumultous and flock by troops daily
to the Parliament&nbsp;... they never cease yawling and
crying “No Bishops, no Bishops!” My lord of Dorset is
appointed to command the train-bands, but the citizens
slight muskets charged with powder. I myself saw the
Guard attempt to drive the citizens forth, but the citizens
blustered at them and would not stir. I saw and heard my
Lord of Dorset entreat them with his hat in his hand and
yet the scoundrels would not move.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It is clear from contemporary documents that Lord
Dorset was preparing to take an active part. He did,
in fact, raise a troop which he equipped at his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>expense, and with which he joined the King at York.
But the old inventories give a list of residue arms and
armour indicating a quantity originally more numerous
than would be necessary to equip a small troop; the whole
house must have been rifled to produce these weapons,
all carefully listed, whether complete or incomplete,
serviceable or not serviceable, old-fashioned or up to
date. One can read between the lines of the list the
anxiety that nothing should be omitted which could
possibly be pressed into the service of the King.
Among the armour at Knole at this date must have
been the fine suit of tilting armour, formerly the property
of the old Lord Treasurer, and now in the
Wallace Collection, described as “a complete suit of
armour&nbsp;... richly decorated by bands and bordering,
deeply etched and partly gilt with a scroll design&nbsp;...
the plain surfaces oxidised to a rich russet-brown
known in inventories of the period as purple armour.”
This suit, which is one of the gems of the Wallace
Collection, had been made in 1575 by Jacob Topp or
Jacobi for Sir Thomas Sackville.</p>

to arm a great number of the malignant party of that County,
to go to York to assist his Majesty; called a Council of War,
to consider of the same, and about 12 of the clock at night
sent out 3 troops of Horse into Kent to seize upon the said
Arms; which they did accordingly on the Sunday following;
and on the Monday brought the same to London and
Sir John Sackville prisoner, there being complete arms for
500 or 600 men.</p>

<p class='c018'>Despite the outcry of plaintive indignation which
went up from Knole, the House of Lords report proves
that their conduct towards Lord Dorset over the
incident was fair, lenient, and even generous:</p>

<p class='c021'>That the Arms of the Earl of Dorset which were at Knole
House, are brought to Town, to be kept from being made
use of against the Parliament,</p>

<p class='c025'>and therefore this House ordered,</p>

<p class='c021'>That such as are rich Arms shall not be made use of, but kept
safely for the Earl of Dorset; but such as are fit to be made
use of for the service of the Kingdom are to be employed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>an Inventory to be taken, and money to be given to the Earl
of Dorset in satisfaction thereof.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus ran the official reports; but Knole, astonished,
aggrieved, and outraged, drew up a fuller list of
injuries. It was the first time rude voices had ever
echoed within those venerable walls or rude hands
rummaged among the sacred possessions, the first time
that orders had been issued there by another than the
master. The Parliament men had entered with arrogance,
spoken with authority, gone beyond their
warrant, and ransacked wantonly—for from what
motive but wantonness could they have taken the
plumes from the bed-tester or the cushions from his
Lordship’s own room? or spoilt the oil in the Painter’s
Chamber? or, indeed, broken forty locks, unless to
overcome such slight resistance in an unnecessarily
high-handed manner? No doubt the novelty of the
experience turned their heads. Rhetorically they were
the representatives of the English Parliament, that
sober and tenacious senate, as stubborn now as at
Runnymede, but in private life they were men, however
insignificant hitherto to Lord Dorset, men who,
when he passed with a swagger, murmured dully
beneath their reluctant deference. The moment when,
cantering up over the crest of the hill, they first saw
the grey forbidding walls and drew rein before the
massive door, their horses’ bits jingling and the restive
hoofs pawing at the gravel, must indeed have been an
experience. Likewise, to ring their spurs on the paving-stones
of the courtyards, to pass from room to room
followed by a protesting and impotent steward, to
stare at the pictures, to lounge on the velvet chairs, to
set out their ink and paper on the solid table of the
parlour and to draw up their indictment. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>August; the rose planted beneath the window of a
Stuart King to commemorate his visit was covered with
its little white blossoms; the turf was smooth and
green; the flowers were bright under the young apple-trees
in the orchard; the beeches and chestnuts were
deep and heavy with the fullness of summer. The
austerity of the Roundheads surely stiffened in the soft
summer spaciousness of Knole. The owner was absent:
they had only his new portrait to gaze at, with scorn
of his brilliant doublet and his curling hair.</p>

<p class='c018'>All things considered, I think that they showed commendable
restraint in their behaviour:</p>

<h4 class='c014'><em>The hurt done at</em> <span class='fss'>KNOLE HOUSE</span> <em>the 14 Day of August 1642 by the</em> <span class='fss'>COMPANY OF HORSEMEN</span> <em>brought by</em> <span class='fss'>CORNELL SANDYS</span>:</h4>

<p class='c032'>There are above forty stock locks and plated locks broken,
which to make good will cost £10.</p>

<p class='c019'>There is of gold branches belonging to the couch in the
rich gallery as much cut away as will not be made good for
£40.</p>

<p class='c019'>And in my Lord’s chamber 12 long cushion-cases
embroidered with satin and gold, and the plumes upon the
bed-tester, to ye value of £30.</p>

<p class='c019'>They have broken open six trunks; in one of them was
money; what is lost of it we know not, in regard the keeper
of it is from home. They have spoiled in the Painter’s
Chamber his oil, and other wrongs there to the value of £40.</p>

<p class='c019'>They have broke into Sir John his Granary and have
taken of his oats and peas, to the quantity of three or four
quarters £4.</p>

<p class='c019'>The arms they have wholly taken away, there being five
waggon-loads of them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor was this the last time that the Parliamentarians
came to Knole. Three years after these events Cromwell’s
commissioners were installed there as the headquarters
of the Court of Sequestration for Kent, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>held their sessions in the Poets’ Parlour, when the
Sackvilles were, for a short time, deprived of the property.
On this occasion there is no record of any
definite damage to the contents of the house, although
a House of Commons notice for January 1645 ordered
that “two-thirds of the goods and estates of the Earl of
Dorset not exceeding the sum of £500 now at Knole
in the county of Kent, and lately discovered there,
shall be employed for the use of the garrison at Dover
Castle, towards the pay of their arrears.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Among the papers in the Muniment Room I find a
letter of a later date from Sir Kenelm Digby to Lord
Dorset, referring to some stolen pictures which he has
been endeavouring to trace in Paris, and recommending
to Lord Dorset a certain M. La Fontaine for “the
much pains and running about he hath used,” suggesting
that he should be rewarded with 20<em>s.</em> and recommended
to good customers to sell his “powders and
cigeours.” I wonder inevitably whether the loss of
these pictures had been due to any action of Cromwell
or his commissioners? Sir Kenelm’s letter, which is
long, rambling, and rather illegible, does not make
any mention of the cause or date of the disappearance.
Sir Kenelm is himself of greater interest, perhaps,
than his letter or the pictures. An intimate
friend of Lord Dorset’s, the author of several housewifely
little treatises, such as <cite>The Closet of Sir Kenelm
Digby</cite> and <cite>Choice and Experimental Receipts</cite>, he was
incidentally the husband of that Venetia Stanley whose
lover Richard Sackville had been. (It has, I may
mention, been suggested that Edward Sackville, not
Richard, was the lover of Lady Digby; and having
regard to what I know of Sir Kenelm’s character I
should think it not inconsistent, even if this were so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>that he should remain on most friendly terms with the
former lover of his wife. He had, after all, not scrupled
to sue Lord Dorset, whether Richard or Edward, for
the continuance after marriage of Lady Digby’s
pension of £500 a year.) Sir Kenelm’s portrait by
Vandyck is at Knole in the Poets’ Parlour; he is a
chubby little man, with a fat outspread hand, and
dimples in the place of knuckles. At one period of the
Civil War he suffered imprisonment, when Lord
Dorset, wishing to beguile his friend’s tedium, advised
him to read the recently published <cite>Religio Medici</cite> of
Sir Thomas Browne: Sir Kenelm took his advice, and
was so much impressed as to embody his observations
in a long letter to Lord Dorset, which was subsequently
printed (1643) by “R. C. for Daniel Frere, to be sold
at his shop at the Red Bull in Little Britain.” I happen
to have the first editions of the <cite>Religio Medici</cite> and the
little companion volume of Sir Kenelm’s <cite>Observations</cite>:
the former is heavily scored or commented by some
appreciative reader, and attention is called in the
margin to favourite passages by the drawing of a tiny
hand with pointing finger, the wrist encircled by a
cuff of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point de Venise</span></i>. Sir Kenelm esteemed his
friend’s taste, and the “spirit and smartness” of the
author, who set out upon his task so excellently poised
with a happy temper. Towards the end of his discourse
Sir Kenelm quite loses his sense of proportion in
his enthusiasm over Lord Dorset’s discernment, and
exclaims:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tu regere imperio populos</span></i> [Sackville] <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento</span></i>,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>and concludes by dating his letter “the 22nd [I think
I may say the 23rd, for I am sure it is morning, and
I think it is day] of December 1642,” thus proving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>that he has sat up all night in prison with Sir Thomas
Browne—and who in this generation could with truth
make such a boast?</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iv</h3>

<p class='c017'>More tragical events than the desecration of his
house or the imprisonment of his chubby friend
marked for Lord Dorset the progress of the Civil War.
His eldest son, Lord Buckhurst, was early taken
prisoner at Miles End Green with Lord Middlesex and
that same Sir Kenelm Digby, and his younger son,
Edward, was also taken prisoner at Kidlington, near
Oxford, and murdered in cold blood by a Roundhead
soldier shortly after, at Abingdon. I know nothing of
this Edward Sackville except that he was knighted at
an early age, was reported to be “a good chymist,” and
was deplored in an obituary poem as being</p>

<p class='c018'>Lord Dorset himself took an active part in the fighting.
At Edgehill he recaptured the Royal Standard
which had been lost to the enemy, and to his answer
during the same battle James II later testified:</p>

<p class='c019'>The old Earl of Dorset, at Edgehill [<em>he wrote</em>], being
commanded by the King my father to carry the Prince
[Charles II] and myself up a hill out of the battle, refused
to do it, and said he would not be thought a coward for ever
a King’s son in Christendom.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think also that one of his speeches is worth printing,
made at the Council table in reply to one of Lord
Bristol’s which urged the continuance of the war. It
is honest, enlightened, bold, and, considering his personal
grievances, very dignified:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c029'>The Earl of Bristol has delivered his opinion; and, my
turn being next to speak, I shall, with the like integrity,
give your Lordships an account of my sentiments in this
great and important business. I shall not, as young students
do in the schools, <em>argumentandi gratia</em>, repugn my Lord of
Bristol’s tenets; but because my conscience tells me they are
not orthodox, nor consonant to the disposition of the Commonwealth,
which, languishing with a tedious sickness, must
be recovered by gentle and easy medicines in consideration
of its weakness rather than by violent vomits, or any other
kind of compelling physic. Not that I shall absolutely labour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to refute my Lord’s opinion, but justly deliver my own,
which, being contrary to his, may appear an express contradiction
of it, which indeed it is not; peace, and that a
sudden one, being as necessary betwixt his Majesty and his
Parliament as light is requisite for the production of the day,
or heat to cherish from above all inferior bodies; this
division betwixt his Majesty and his Parliament being as if
[by miracle] the sun should be separated from his beams, and
divided from his proper essence. I would not, my Lords,
be ready to embrace a peace that would be more disadvantageous
to us than the present war, which, as the Earl
of Bristol says, “would destroy our estates and families.”
The Parliament declares only against delinquents; such as
they conjecture have miscounselled his Majesty, and be the
authors of these tumults in the Commonwealth. But these
declarations of theirs, except such crimes can be proved
against them, are of no validity. The Parliament will do
nothing unjustly, nor condemn the innocent; and certainly
innocent men had not need to fear to appear before any
judges whatsoever. And he, who shall for any cause prefer
his own private good before the public utility, is but an ill
son of the Commonwealth. <em>For my particular, in these
wars I have suffered as much as any; my house hath been
searched, my arms taken thence, and my son-and-heir committed
to prison. Yet I shall wave these discourtesies, because
I know there was a necessity it should be so; and as
the darling business of the kingdom, the honour and prosperity
of the King, study to reconcile all these differences
betwixt his Majesty and his Parliament; and so to reconcile
them, that they shall no way prejudice his royal prerogative;
of which I believe the Parliament being a loyal defender</em>
[knowing the subject’s property depends on it; for, if
sovereigns cannot enjoy their rights, their subjects cannot]
will never endeavour to be infringed; so that, if doubts and
jealousies were taken away by a fair treaty between his
Majesty and the Parliament, no doubt a means might be
devised to rectify these differences—the honour of the King,
the estate of us his followers and counsellors, the privileges
of Parliament, and property of the subject, be infallibly preserved
in safety: and neither the King stoop in this to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>subjects, nor the subjects be deprived of their just liberties
by the King. And whereas my Lord of Bristol observes,
“that in Spain very few civil dissensions arise, because the
subjects are truly subjects, and the Sovereign truly a
Sovereign”; that is, as I understand, the subjects are
scarcely removed a degree from slaves, nor the Sovereign
from a tyrant; here in England the subjects have, by long-received
liberties granted to our ancestors by their Kings,
made their freedom resolve into a second nature; and
neither is it safe for our Kings to strive to introduce the
Spanish Government upon these free-born nations, nor just
for the people to suffer that Government to be imposed upon
them, which I am certain his Majesty’s goodness never
intended. And whereas my Lord of Bristol intimates the
strength and bravery of our army as an inducement to the
continuation of these wars, which he promises himself will
produce a fair and happy peace; in this I am utterly
repugnant to his opinion; for, grant that we have an army
of gallant and able men, which, indeed, cannot be denied,
yet we have infinite disadvantages on our side, the Parliament
having double our number, and surely [though our
enemies] persons of as much bravery, nay, and sure to be
daily supported, when any of their number fails; a benefit
which we cannot bestow, they having the most populous
part of the kingdom at their devotion; all, or most, of the
cities, considerable towns and ports, together with the
mainest pillar of the kingdom’s safety, the sea, at their command,
and the navy; and, which is most material of all, an
inexhaustible Indies of money to pay their soldiers, out of the
liberal contributions of coin and plate sent in by people of
all conditions, who account the Parliament’s cause their
cause, and so think themselves engaged to part with the
uttermost penny of their estates in their defence, whom they
esteem the patriots of their liberties. These strengths of
theirs and the defects of ours considered, I conclude it
necessary for all our safeties, and the good of the whole
Commonwealth, to beseech his Majesty to take some present
order for a treaty of peace betwixt himself and his high court
of Parliament, who, I believe, are so loyal and obedient to
his sacred Majesty, that they will propound nothing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>shall be prejudicial to his royal prerogative, or repugnant
to their fidelity and duty.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is, of course, not at all to my purpose to follow
the course of the Civil War, but only to say that after
the execution of the King Lord Dorset made a vow,
which he is believed to have kept, that he would never
again stir out of his house until he should be carried out
of it in his coffin. He did not, in point of fact, survive
the King by very many years, but died in 1652 and
was buried at Withyham.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> Knole in the Reign of Charles II<br /> CHARLES<br /> <span class='large'>6th<br /> Earl <em>of</em> Dorset</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Edward Sackville was succeeded by his
son Richard, married to Lady Frances Cranfield,
a considerable heiress, who, on the death
of her brother, inherited the fortune and property of
their father, Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, sometime
Treasurer to James I. I mention this marriage
especially, because it brought to the Sackvilles the
house called Copt Hall in Essex and its contents, which
included much of the finest furniture now at Knole,
some of the tapestry, the many portraits of the Cranfields
by Mytens and Dobson, the series of historical
portraits in the Brown Gallery, and the Mytens copies
of Raphael’s cartoons. There are a number of receipts
at Knole to no less than six different carriers, for
wagon-loads of effects removed from Copt Hall to
Knole at the cost of £2. 5<em>s.</em> per load. From Copt Hall
also came the carved stone shield now in the Stone
Court on the roof of the Great Hall. The Copt Hall
estate was sold in 1701 for the approximate sum of
twenty thousand pounds. The draft of the marriage
settlement is at Knole:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>January 25th, 1640</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The Earl of Middlesex is to assure ten thousand pounds
to the Earl of Dorset in marriage with the Lady Frances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Cranfield to the Lord Buckhurst to be paid in times and
manner following:</p>

<p class='c019'>He is to retain the money in his hands, paying yearly to
the young couple towards their maintenance by equal
portions at Michaelmas and our Lady Day £800 per annum
until a jointure be made of £1500 per annum, by the Lord
Buckhurst joining with the Earl of Dorset when he shall
come to full age.</p>

<p class='c019'>And if the Lord Buckhurst [which God forbid] shall
decease before the said lady, or a jointure so made, then the
ten thousand pound shall be the sole use of the said lady.
But if the said lady [which God forbid] should die before
the Lord Buckhurst without children, the said portion or so
much shall remain not laid out by consent of the Earl of
Dorset in purchasing in lands or leases, shall be paid to the
said Earl of Dorset.</p>

<p class='c018'>And in the same connection there are some notes
from Edward, Lord Dorset to Lord Middlesex, one
written “this Thursday morning at 5 of the clock,”
apologising for the “bad character” which Lord
Middlesex must decipher—and indeed the writing is
all but illegible—but he is obliged to write as he must
go presently into Kent to dispose some bargains and
sales.</p>

<p class='c018'>No particular interest attaches to Richard Sackville,
save that he translated <cite>Le Cid</cite> into English verse and
wrote a poem on Ben Jonson, but there are at Knole
some memorandum books in his handwriting (between
1660 and 1670) which are worth quoting, I think, for
the following illuminating extracts:</p>

<p class='c018'>There are various other notes in the same books:
Thomas Porter, going to Knole, was to have five
shillings a week board-wages; and, judging from the
following, Lord Dorset evidently could not wholly
trust his memory unaided: “My French shot-bag;
an hammer, and some playthings for Tom, a bone
knife, etc. A great Iron chafing-dish, or a fire-pan to
set it upon.” And again, “A silver porringer for little

<p class='c017'>This Richard Sackville and Frances Cranfield had
seven sons and six daughters. There are some delightful
portraits of the little girls at Knole, one in particular
of Lady Anne and Lady Frances, painted in a
garden, leading a squirrel on a blue ribbon, and in the
chapel at Withyham there is an elaborate monument to
commemorate the youngest son, Thomas, no doubt the
“little Tom” for whom the playthings and the silver
porringer were to be remembered. The monument
bears the following inscription:</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Of the other children, save of the eldest, there is no
record, or none worth quoting: many of them died,
as happened with such pitiable frequency, at a very
early age: Lionel, aged three; Catherine, aged one;
Cranfield, aged fourteen days; Elizabeth, aged two
years; Anne, aged three. The eldest son, however, is
one of the most jovial and debonair figures in the Knole
portrait-gallery, Charles, the sixth Earl—let us call
him the Restoration Earl—the jolly, loose-living,
magnificent Mæcenas, “during the whole of his life
the patron of men of genius and the dupe of women,
and bountiful beyond measure to both.” He furnished
Knole with silver, and peopled it with poets and
courtesans; he left us the Poets’ Parlour, rich with
memories of Pope and Dryden, Prior and Shadwell,
D’Urfey and Killigrew; he left us the silver and ebony
stands on which he was in the habit in hours of relaxation
of placing his cumbersome periwig; he left us his
portraits, both as the bewigged and be-ribboned
courtier, and as the host, wrapped in a loose robe, a
turban twisted round his head; he left us his gay and
artificial stanzas to Chloris and Dorinda, and his
rousing little song written on the eve of a naval
engagement. He is not, perhaps, a very admirable
figure. He was not above trafficking in court appointments;
he disturbed London by a rowdy youth; he
was reported to have passed on his mistresses to the
King; he ended his life in mental and moral decay
with a squalid woman at Bath. He followed the
fashions of his age, and the most that can be claimed
for him is that he should stand, along with his inseparables
Rochester and Sedley, as the prototype of
that age. But for all that, there is about such geniality,
such generosity, and such munificence, a certain coarse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>lovableness which holds an indestructible charm for
the English race. It is that which makes Charles the
Second a more popular monarch than William the
Third: Herrick a more popular poet than Milton.
Last but not least, Charles Sackville is connected with
that most attractive figure of the English stage—Nell
Gwyn.</p>

<p>CHARLES SACKVILLE, <span class='sc'>6th Earl of Dorset, K.G.</span><br /><br /><em>From the portrait by</em> <span class='sc'>Sir Godfrey Kneller</span> <em>in the Poets’ Parlour at Knole</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>It is not known precisely in what year he was born,
but it was either 1639, 1640, or 1642, so that he must
have been a young man somewhere in the neighbourhood
of twenty when Charles II came to the throne.
He had been educated by a tutor, one Jennings, and
sent abroad with him: as Jennings wrote home of him
in measured terms surprising in that age of sycophancy,
saying “I doubt not he will attain to some perfection,”
he probably held but a low opinion of the abilities of
his pupil. I do not know at what age Lord Buckhurst,
as he then was, returned to England, but he must have
been quite young, for in 1660 he becomes Colonel of
a regiment of foot, commands 104 men, and receives
a yearly allowance of £70 from his father, and the
references to him in Pepys begin in 1661 when he was
not more than twenty-one or twenty-two. He was,
says Dr. Johnson with characteristic disapproval and
severity, “eager of the riotous and licentious pleasures
which young men of high rank, who aspired to be
thought wits, at that time imagined themselves entitled
to indulge.” Many of his pranks have been placed on
record. They are neither very funny nor very edifying.
On one occasion he and his brother Edward, with
three friends, were committed to Newgate for killing
an innocent man in a brawl, and should no doubt have
been tried for murder, but as those contretemps could
be arranged with very little difficulty the charge was
modified to manslaughter.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c020'><sup>[8]</sup></a> On another occasion, the
full details of which are not allowed to remain in the
expurgated edition of Pepys, Lord Buckhurst, Sir
Charles Sedley, and Sir Thomas Ogle got drunk at the
Cock Tavern in Bow Street, where they went out on
to a balcony, and Sedley took off all his clothes and
harangued the crowd which collected below: the
crowd, in indignation, drove them in with stones, and
broke the windows of the house; for this offence all
three gentlemen were indicted and Sedley was fined
£500. On yet another occasion Buckhurst and Sedley
spent the night in prison for brawling with the watch,
and were delivered only on the King’s intervention.
On yet another, Pepys records that “the King was
drunk at Saxam with Sedley and Buckhurst, the night
that my Lord Arlington came thither, and would not
give him audience, or could not.” These and similar
exploits recall the more celebrated escapade of
Rochester as an astrologer, which at least had in it a
humorous element entirely lacking in the mere rioting
of drunken young men like Buckhurst and Sedley.
It is not very surprising to learn that although he
“inherited not only the paternal estate of the Sackvilles
but likewise that of the Cranfields, Earls of
Middlesex in right of his mother, yet at his decease
his son, then only eighteen years of age, possessed so
slender a fortune that his guardians when they sent
him to travel on the Continent allowed him only eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>hundred pounds a year for his provision,” nor that
“extenuated by pleasures and indulgences, he sank
into a premature old age.” Before sinking into this old
age, however, he lived through the full enjoyment of a
splendid youth. It is difficult to imagine an era in
English history more favourable to a young man of
his type and fortune than the early years of Charles II,
when the King himself was the ringleader in the outburst
of revolt against that iron-grey period of
Puritanism through which the country had just passed.
Dresses became extravagant, silver ornate, speech
licentious; the theatres, which had been closed for
over twenty years, reopened, the costumes and scenery
being now on an elaborate scale never contemplated
before; women—a daring innovation—appeared in
the women’s rôles; the King and his brother patronised
the play-houses with all the young bloods of the court;
coaches clattered through the streets of London, yes,
even on a Sunday. There is, of course, another side
to the picture—the sullen disapproval of the serious-minded,
the squalor of a London shortly to be rotted
by plague and terribly purified by fire—but with this
side we have in the present connection no concern. We
are in the gay upper stratum of prosperity and fashion,
fortunate in the extraordinary vividness of our
visualisation; we know not only the principal characters,
but also the crowd of “supers” pressing behind
them; we know their comings and goings, their
intrigues, their rivalries, their amusements, the names
of their mistresses. We are now at Whitehall, now at
Epsom, now at Tunbridge Wells, now at Richmond.
We are, indeed, very deeply in Pepys’ debt.</p>

<p class='c018'>In this world, therefore, so intimately familiar to
any reader of the great diarist, Lord Buckhurst moves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>noisily with Rochester and Buckingham, Etherege and
Sedley, “the first gentleman,” says Horace Walpole,
“of the voluptuous court of Charles II.” We are told
that he refused the King’s offers of employment in
order to enjoy his pleasures with the greater freedom,
or, as he himself wrote with much frankness:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>May knaves and fools grow rich and great,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>And the world think them wise,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>While I lie dying at her feet</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>And all the world despise.</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Let conquering Kings new triumphs raise,</em></div>

      <div class='line in2'><em>Her arms much softer nights.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This did not prevent him from enrolling as a
volunteer in the Dutch war of 1665, when he was
present at a naval battle, and when the song which he
was reported to have written on the eve of the engagement
was brought to London and bandied from mouth
to mouth about the town. Dr. Johnson shows himself
sceptical as to this picturesque legend of the origin of
the verses. “Seldom is any splendid story wholly
true,” he observes; and continues, “I have heard from
the Earl of Orrery, that Lord Buckhurst had been a
week employed upon it, and only re-touched, or
finished it, on the memorable evening.” However this
may be, both song and story remain: I have told the
story, and quote the song:</p>

written by three authors in collaboration. It seems to
have achieved popularity, and was set to music, also
a parody was written of it by Lord Halifax under the
title “The New Court: Being an Excellent New Song

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It is shortly after this battle that Nell Gwyn first
appears in Lord Buckhurst’s life. London’s two
theatres—the Duke’s Theatre, near Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, and the King’s Theatre, or, more familiarly,
The Theatre, in Drury Lane—were then the great
new resort and amusement, from the King and his
brother in their boxes down to the rabble in the pit.
Until the reign of Charles II the presence of the King
in a common play-house was an unknown thing: such
plays or masques as they had witnessed were always
specially performed for them either in the halls or
cock-pits of their palaces, but it now became the
fashion for not only the King and the Duke of York,
but also for the Queen to patronise the theatres. There
were other innovations. The public was no longer satisfied
with the makeshift scenery of pre-Commonwealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>days, which had too often consisted of a placard hung
upon a nail, “<em>A wood</em>,” or “<em>A throne-room</em>,” or
whatever it might be. Nor were the dresses of the
actors as careless as they had formerly been, but
patrons of the stage would give their old clothes, which,
if shabby, were no doubt still sufficiently magnificent
to produce their effect at a distance. Even a step
further in progress was the appearance of women on
the stage, “foul and undecent women now, and never
till now, permitted to appear and act,” says Evelyn,
full of indignation, “who, inflaming several young
noblemen and gallants, became their misses and to
some their wives, witness the Earl of Oxford, Sir R.
Howard, Prince Rupert, the Earl of Dorset, and
another greater person than any of them.” A theatre
of that day must have been a noisy, ruffling, ill-lighted
place. The ceiling immediately above the pit was
either open to the sky or else inadequately covered
over, so that in the event of rain the whole of the pit
was apt to surge into the dry parts of the theatre. The
ladies in the audience, especially if the performance
happened to be a comedy, sat for the most part in
masks. The sallow face of the King, framed by the
heavy curls, leered down over the edge of a box. In
the body of the theatre lounged the bucks of the
town, exchanging pleasantry and impudence with the
orange-girls who were so indispensable a feature.</p>

<p class='c018'>These orange-girls stood in the pit, crying
“Oranges! will you have any oranges?” and were
under the control of a superior known as Orange Moll,
a famous figure of London theatre life. One may quote,
to give some further idea of the relations between the
young dandies and the orange-sellers, some of the
stage directions in Shadwell’s <cite>True Widow</cite>, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>fourth act, laid in the Playhouse, “Several young coxcombs
fool with the orange-women,” or “He sits
down and lolls in the orange-wench’s lap,” or, “Raps
people on the back and twirls their hats, and then looks
demurely, as if he did not do it.” Amongst these girls,
at the beginning of her career, was Nell Gwyn, of
whom Rochester wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... <em>the basket her fair arm did suit,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Laden with pippins and Hesperian fruit;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>This first step raised, to the wondering pit she sold</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>The lovely fruit smiling with streaks of gold</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>and who has come down to us as a figure full of disreputable
charm, witty Nelly, pretty Nelly, Nelly
whose foot was least of any woman’s in England, Nelly
who paid the debts of those whom she saw being haled
off to prison, Nelly the pert, the apt, the kind-hearted,
Nelly who “continued to hang on her clothes with her
usual negligence when she was the King’s mistress, but
whatever she did became her.” This merry creature
said of herself that she was brought up in a brothel and
served strong waters to gentlemen: it is probable that
she was born in the Coal Yard at Drury Lane (now
Goldsmith Street), and, wherever she may have been
brought up, at a very early age she joined the orange-girls
at the King’s Theatre. In due time her looks and
her wit attracted attention and she went on the stage.
Pepys, who was evidently much taken with the “bold
merry slut,” leaves a particularly charming record of
her one May day:</p>

<p class='c019'><em>May 1st.</em> To Westminster, in the way meeting many
milkmaids with their garlands upon their pails, dancing with
a fiddler before them; and saw pretty Nelly standing at her
lodgings door in Drury Lane in her smock sleeves and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>bodice, looking upon one; she seemed a mighty pretty
creature.</p>

<p class='c018'>This being in May (1657), when Nell was sixteen, and
had already been acting for at least two years, in July
of the same year the diarist was told, which troubled
him, that “my Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away
from the King’s House, and gives her £100 a year, so
as she hath sent her parts to the house and will act no
more.”</p>

<p class='c025'>was sung of Buckhurst. He was then twenty-seven or
so, Nell Gwyn sixteen, and together they kept “merry
house” at Epsom. Pepys went down to Epsom one
day and heard reports of their merriments: he pitied
Nelly, exclaiming, “Poor girl!” and pitied still more
her loss to the King’s Theatre; but he does not expressly
state whether he saw the pair or not. In any
case, the housekeeping at Epsom did not continue for
very long, for by August she was again acting in
London, and Pepys had “a great deal of discourse with
Orange Moll, who tells us that Nell is already left by
my Lord Buckhurst, and that he makes sport of her,
and swears she hath had all she could get of him.” It
would appear from this that Buckhurst, contrary to
what has been said of him, did not sell Nell Gwyn to
the King, for even Pepys, who would surely have been
among the first and best informed, does not mention
the King having “sent for Nelly” until January of
the following year. I hope, therefore, that the charges
of his having accepted bribes in exchange for Nelly
may be exploded. A great many things were whispered—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>he had been promised the peerage of Middlesex,
that he had been given a thousand pounds a year, that
he had been sent on “a sleeveless errand” into France
to leave the coast clear for the King, that he refused
to give her up until he had been repaid for all the
expenses she had entailed upon him. I do not think
that such a Jewish spirit is at all in keeping with the
rest of his character as we know it, with his generosity
and general lavishness, nor does it seem probable
that he would so have bargained with a king whose
favour he was anxious to retain. By 1669 it is certain
that Nell was definitely the King’s mistress and all
connection with Buckhurst over. But we find that
years afterwards the house called Burford House, at
Windsor, is granted by Charles II to Charles, Earl of
Dorset and Middlesex, W. Chaffinch, Esq., and others,
in trust for Ellen Gwyn for life, with remainder to the
Earl of Burford, the King’s natural son, in tail male;
further, among the Knole papers is the original deed
of 1683 appointing Lord Dorset her trustee and
trustee to her son by Charles II; and, dated 1678,
there is an allusion to her former lover in one of Nell’s
infrequent and ill-spelt letters: “My lord Dorseit
apiers worze in thre months, for he drinks aile with
Shadwell and Mr. Haris at the Duke’s house all day
long.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Nell Gwyn thus passed out of Lord Buckhurst’s life,
which she had so briefly entered, a well-assorted pair,
I think, in every respect—he, idle, spoilt, heavy and
magnificent; she, coarse, witty, feminine. There is a
portrait of her at Knole, which I suppose was acquired
by him, and I once happened to see a set of spoons in
a loan exhibition which were catalogued as bearing the
arms of Sackville with those of Nell Gwyn. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Sackville shield was correct enough, but whether the
other quarterings were the arms of Gwyn, or whether
indeed the orange-girl was entitled to any heraldic
device, I am, of course, unable to say.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>

<p class='c017'>Pomp, wealth, and infirmities now began to take the
place of brilliant youth and comparative irresponsibility.
The frivolous Lord Buckhurst became Earl of
Dorset and Middlesex, he succeeded to the estates of
the Cranfields, he married, he was made Lord Chamberlain,
he was given the Garter, and he had a fit of
apoplexy in the King’s bedroom. In order to recover
his health he went abroad; his passport is at Knole, on
yellow parchment, with the King’s signature at the top:</p>

<p class='c019'>Charles the <em>Second</em> by the Grace of God, etc., to all
admirals, vice-admirals, captains of our ships at sea,
governors, commanders, soldiers, mayors, sheriffs, justices
of the peace, bailiffs, constables, customers, controllers,
searchers, and all other our loving subjects whom it may
concern, greeting:</p>

<p class='c019'><em>Whereas</em> our right trusty and right well-beloved cousin
<span class='sc'>Charles</span> Earl <em>of</em> Dorset <em>and</em> Middlesex hath desired our
licence to go beyond the seas for recovery of his health, we
are graciously pleased to condescend thereunto, and accordingly
our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby require,
that you permit and suffer the said Charles Earl of Dorset
and Middlesex with six servants by name Richard Raphael,
Robert Pennock, Thomas Bridges, —— Solomon, John
Carter, and Christopher Garner, also forty pounds in money,
and all baggage, utensils, carriages, and necessaries to the
said Earl belonging, freely to embark in any of our ports and
from thence to pass beyond the seas without any let,
hindrance, or molestation whatsoever. And you are likewise
to permit the said Earl and his servants at their return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>back into this Kingdom to pass with like freedom, into the
same, affording them [as there may be occasion] all requisite
aid and furtherance as well going as returning. And for so
doing this shall be your warrant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Given at our court at Windsor, the 23rd day of <em>August</em>
1681, in the three and thirtieth year of our reign.</p>

<p class='c018'>There is also a letter from one of the servants mentioned
in the passport, saying that they had had a good
passage to Dieppe, “except Mr. Raphael, who was
kind to ye fishes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>There is another letter, from the Mr. Raphael in
question, written home to Robert Pennock from Paris
while on the same journey, saying that his Lordship
wants the pond finished against the spring, orders the
gardener to manure all the trees, and wishes Pennock
to obtain a sure-footed nag, as his Lordship intends
for the future only to make use of a saddle-horse
between Copt Hall and London to prevent the pain
of the gravel, of which infirmity his Lordship has
lately been much troubled.</p>

<p class='c018'>About this time he married. I have in my hands one
of his love-letters, in faded ink; there is no date, no
beginning, and no signature: it is superscribed “for
the Countess of Falmouth,” and enclosed is a lock of
reddish-brown hair—most dead and poignant token—of
surprising length when one considers the heavy wig
which was to be worn over it.</p>

<p class='c019'>I must beg leave that we may be a little earlier than
ordinary at Hick’s hall to-day, for to-morrow, i may be so
miserable as not to see you; besides i am in pain till i can
clear some doubts that have kept me waking all night;
something i observed in your looks which shewed you had
been displeased, at what i dare not ask; but till i know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>i must suffer the torment of uncertain guessing; though
i am pretty well assured i could not be concerned in it
[more than in the trouble it gave you]; being so perfectly
yours, that it will of necessity be counted your own fault
if ever i offend you, since ’tis you alone have the government
not only of all my actions but of my very thoughts, to confirm
you in the belief of this truth i do from this moment
give up to you all my pretences to freedom or any power
over myself, and though you may justly think it below you to
be owned the sovereign of so mean a dominion as my heart,
i have yet confidence upon my knees to offer it you; since
never any prince could boast of so clear a title, and so
absolute power, as you shall ever possess in it.</p>

<p class='c018'>His total income for the year 1698–99 was £7650
4<em>s.</em> 3½<em>d.</em>—the curious accuracy of these sums does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>seem to tally with the confusion to which I have
referred—that is to say, about £40,000 of modern
money. It may be interesting, while on this subject, to
show some of the means common among the great
nobles for filling their pockets. In 1697, for instance,
we read that “My Lord Chamberlain Dorset has sold
the keepership of Greenwich Park to the Earl of
Romney” [James Vernon to Matthew Prior], and in
the same year—this is when he was getting on in years
and entirely withdrawing from politics—“Lord Dorset
hath resigned his office of Lord Chamberlain to the
Earl of Sunderland for the sum of ten thousand
pounds,” but where was this sum to come from? not
out of Lord Sunderland’s pocket; no, but “<em>which his
Majesty pays</em>.” There was yet another method by
which money might conveniently be raised: it is well
illustrated by Dorset’s petition regarding the dues on
tobacco:</p>

<p class='c018'>To this petition I should like to add another, representing
the other point of view, that of the unfortunate
people who had the King’s soldiers quartered upon
them in intolerable numbers, and were, as it appears,
not refunded for the expenses to which they had been
put. I add this the more willingly, as Dorset was
commonly reputed the friend of the poor, and it is said
of him that “crowds of poor daily thronged his gates,
expecting thence their bread. The lazy and the sick,
as he accidentally saw them, were removed from the
street to the physician, and not only cured but supplied
with what might enable them to resume their former
calling. The prisoner has often been released by my
Lord’s paying the debt, and the condemned been
pardoned, through his intercession with the sovereign.”</p>

<p class='c042'>Some of the foregoing papers, then, account for his
income; we have also some notes as to his expenses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>To his servants he paid £8 to £10 a year for “ordinary
men and maids.” For beef he paid 2<em>s.</em> a stone; for
mutton, 3<em>d.</em> a pound; pullets were 6<em>d.</em> each; a goose
was 1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>; a pheasant, 1<em>s.</em>; a hare, 8<em>d.</em>; a tongue, 1<em>s.</em>;
a partridge, 9<em>d.</em>; a pigeon, 3<em>d.</em>; a turkey, 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; a

4<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; a peck of damsons, 1<em>s.</em> Wheat cost him 7<em>s.</em> a
bushel; salt, 5<em>s.</em> a bushel. For 130 walnuts he paid
1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, and for a dozen candles 5<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>—a surprising
price. We have also a detailed account of his cellar.
For strong beer he paid 35<em>s.</em> a hogshead, and for
small beer 10<em>s.</em> a hogshead. From July 1690 to
November 1691 his total wine bill amounted to
£598 19<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>, an alarming sum when we reflect that
he was paying only 5<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em> for a gallon of red port,
6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> for a gallon of sherry, and 8<em>s.</em> for a gallon of
canary. We are given the details entered in the cellar
from August 1690 to January 1691; they are sufficiently
formidable: 425 gallons of red port, 85 gallons
of sherry, 72 gallons of canary, 63 gallons of white
port, and a quart of hock. One wonders whether Lord
Dorset was “laying down,” or whether this quantity
was adequate only to the six months shown on the
account book.</p>

<p class='c042'>Lord Dorset seems to have carried large sums of
money about on his person, for the steward’s account
book at Knole shows a regular daily entry of 10<em>s.</em> for
loose change to his Lordship, and when he was set
upon by footpads near Tyburn they robbed him not
only of his gold George, but also of forty or fifty
pounds. This does not perhaps seem a very enormous
sum for a wealthy man to carry, but it must always be
remembered that in order to obtain the modern
equivalent it is necessary to multiply by at least five.</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Before leaving the Knole papers of this date—and
there is much that I have regretfully discarded, many
letters, for instance, regarding the election of Lord
Buckhurst to the House of Commons, which throw
interesting sidelights upon the methods of electioneering
in the early days of Charles II—I should like to
quote one letter of unknown authorship, relating to
the Rye House Plot. The letter is addressed to Lord
Dorset: it is unsigned and undated, but the date must
be placed, by virtue of internal evidence, in July 1683,
by reason of the reference to Captain Walcot who was
tried on July 12th in connection with the plot.</p>

<p class='c037'>The party that went for my Lord Essex found him in his
garden gathering of nut-meg peaches, he was lodged in my
Lord Feversham’s lodgings, in Whitehall, and the next day,
having not made use of the favour of pen and ink, so well
as my Lord Howard hath, he was sent to the Tower.</p>

<p class='c037'>My Lord Howard runs like a spout, fresh, and fresh he
hath writ enough to hang himself, and 1 hundred more, and
cried enough to drown himself, he hath cast his lodgings in
Whitehall.</p>

<p class='c037'>Sir John Burlace was brought before the Council yesterday,
upon sending intelligence to my Lord Lovelace that
there was a warrant against him. He stayed one night in the
messenger’s hands and was this morning bail for my Lord
Lovelace, and both of them dismissed.</p>

<p class='c037'>The enclosed is an account how far the Grand Jury hath
proceeded, that little note hath the names of some of the
Grand Jury.</p>

<p class='c037'>None were tried this afternoon but Capt. Walcot who was
cast by a most clear evidence being at several consults, the
places all named, his raising of arms, his own letter to the
King, and one of the consults was at the Vulture, Ludgate
Hill, and Sheppard’s House, he had very little to say for
himself, but that the witnesses swore away his life to secure
their own, he excepted against all Jury men that were of the
lieutenancy and behaved himself with a great deal of decency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and resolution. They had a declaration ready drawn by
Goodenough so soon as ever the King was killed, and
particular men appointed to murder the most considerable
persons. Borne by name was to kill this Lord Keeper, and
refused it because it looked like an unneighbourly thing, my
Lord pulled off his hat and said Thank you, neighbour.</p>

<p class='c042'>I find also, dated 1690, this curious vocabulary of
thieves’ slang scribbled on the back of some particulars
relating to the appointment of a new incumbent
for Sevenoaks. Unfortunately half the alphabet is
missing:</p>

<p class='c044'>In 1685 Charles II died, and with him departed that
devil-may-care existence into which Lord Dorset had
fitted so readily and so well. He was no favourite with
the new King; for one thing he had addressed verses
in this vein to Lady Dorchester, mistress of James II:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Tell me, Dorinda, why so gay,</em></div>

      <div class='line'><em>To stop th’ approaches of decay,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>And mend a ruined face?</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Wilt thou still sparkle in the box,</em></div>

      <div class='line in2'><em>Make thee a fine young thing?</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>He appears also at this time to have grown more
serious in his outlook, for he disapproved of the new
King so strongly as to have taken an active part in the
accession of William III to the English throne. He
was instrumental, indeed, in arranging the escape of
Princess (afterwards Queen) Anne:</p>

<p class='c037'>That evening [<em>says Macaulay</em>] Anne retired to her
chamber as usual. At dead of night she rose, and, accompanied
by her friend Sarah [Churchill] and two other female
attendants, stole down the back stairs in a dressing-gown and
slippers. The fugitives gained the open street unchallenged.
A hackney coach was in waiting for them there. Two men
guarded the humble vehicle. One of them was Compton,
Bishop of London, the princess’ old tutor; the other was the
magnificent and accomplished Dorset, whom the extremity
of the public danger had roused from his luxurious repose.
The coach drove instantly to Aldersgate Street&nbsp;... there
the princess passed the night. On the following morning she
set out for Epping Forest. In that wild tract [it is amusing
to think of Epping as a wild tract]—in that wild tract Dorset
possessed a venerable mansion [Copt Hall], the favourite
resort, during many years, of wits and poets&nbsp;...</p>

<p class='c042'>but Macaulay was evidently not in possession of, or
else ignored (although it is difficult to believe that the
incident would not have tempted his picturesque and
vivid pen), the detail related by Dorset’s grandson, Lord
George Sackville, that</p>

<p class='c037'>one of her Royal Highness’ shoes sticking fast in the mud,
the accident threatened to impede her escape; but Lord
Dorset, immediately drawing off his white glove, put it on
the Princess’ foot, and placed her safely in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c042'>That Lord Dorset had no sympathy with popery is
proved by this letter, which is among the Duke of
Rutland’s papers:</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Lord Dorset last night [27th January 1688] while at
supper at Lady Northampton’s, received the following letter
with cross on top:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c046'>
    <div><span class='large'>+</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c047'>’Twere pity that one of the best of men should be lost
for the worst of causes. Do not sacrifice a life everybody
values for a religion yourself despise. Make your peace
with your lawful sovereign, or know that after this 27th
of January you have not long to live. Take this warning
from a friend before repentance is in vain;</p>

<p class='c042'>and it is apparent that he had not lost touch with his
old friends of the Court of Charles II, for we find, in
1688, that he placed Knole at the disposal of the Queen
Dowager (Catherine of Braganza),</p>

<p class='c037'>without any consideration of rent, besides the sole use of his
park, and if she makes any alterations to have timber out
of his woods for that purpose. The Queen Dowager will
consider the repairs of the Lord Dorset’s house, which will
amount to £20,000.</p>

<p class='c042'>But whether she availed herself of the offer, for however
short a period, I cannot say.</p>

<p class='c042'>Lord Dorset was in favour with William III, and
continued to hold his office of Lord Chamberlain until
he resigned it in 1697. This was the date when he
withdrew from all public life. His second wife had
died six years before; Dorset himself was approaching
sixty, and the excesses of his youth had long since
begun to tell. The end of a life which opened with
such gaiety and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> offers a very sordid picture.
From his portraits it is easy to see that he has grown
heavy and apoplectic: his features are coarsened and
swollen; his double chins hang in folds over his
voluminous robes, his ruffles, and his ribbons. He
could not hope to enjoy his life at both ends. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>must have been good days when he got drunk with
Sedley, or kept house with Nelly at Epsom, or exchanged
witticisms with the King in the passages at
Whitehall, or sat after supper round the dining-room
table at Knole with Dryden and Killigrew and
Rochester; but after running up the account the debt
had to be paid at last. It was all very well for Prior,
who owed him everything, to get gracefully out of a
difficulty by saying that he drivelled better sense than
most men could talk: the remainder of the account is
not pretty to contemplate. “A few years before he
died,” is the story told by his grandson, Lord George
Sackville, “he married a woman named Roche of very
obscure connections, who held him in a sort of
captivity down at Bath, where he expired at about
sixty-nine.” There is a contemporary letter, which
says, “My Lord Dorset owns his marriage with one
of his acquaintances, one of the Roches. Do you think
anyone will pity him?” “She suffered few persons
to approach him during his last illness, or rather,
decay,” Lord George’s account continues, “and was
supposed to have converted his weakness of mind to
her own objects of personal acquisition. He was indeed
considered to be fallen into a state of such imbecility as
would render it necessary to appoint guardians, with a
view to prevent his injuring the family estate, but the
intention was nevertheless abandoned. You have no
doubt heard, and it is a fact, that with a view of ascertaining
whether Lord Dorset continued to be of a sane
mind, Prior, whom he had patronised and always
regarded with predilection, was sent down to Bath by
the family.” Having obtained access to the Earl, and
conversed with him, Prior made his report in these
words, “Lord Dorset is certainly greatly declined in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>his understanding, but he <em>drivels</em> so much better sense
even now than any other man can <em>talk</em>, that you must
not call me into court as a witness to prove him an
idiot.” Congreve, appropriating the gist of the remark,
observed after visiting Dorset on his deathbed, “Faith,
he slabbers more wit dying than other people do in
their best health.” Swift also, who was an intimate
friend of Lady Betty Germaine and the Dorsets in the
succeeding generation, remarks that Charles grew dull
in his old age. Ann Roche, who guarded so jealously
her ancient and mouldy bird of Paradise, managed to
provide handsomely for herself under his will. He left
her not only the house in Stable Yard, St. James, which
was hers before her marriage, but also lands and
messuages in Sussex, two beds with the furniture thereunto
belonging in his house at Knole, the furniture of
two rooms there, all the household linen there, and
£500 to be increased to £20,000 if his son should die
without issue. The marriage only lasted a short time,
for in 1705 Lord Dorset died—old, enfeebled, and semi-imbecile.</p>

<p class='c042'>It is not surprising to learn that he left a number of
illegitimate children: we know of at least four for certain,
and there was probably a fifth, a son, as it is difficult to
account otherwise for the William Sackville who writes,
signing a remarkably ungrammatical letter with a remarkably
beautiful signature, to ask for money, as he has
lately “gained the affection of a young lady,” and this,
he promises, will be “the last trouble that ever I shall
give your Lordship; it would come very seasonable to
my present circumstances who has been harassed and
ruined by the fate of war this four years past and have
done the government good service, and never rewarded
as those that deserved it less has.” The other four were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>daughters. There is a petition at Knole from one of
them:</p>

<p class='c036'><em>To</em> the Right Hon. <span class='fss'>CHARLES</span> Earl <em>of</em> Dorset <em>and</em>
Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of Their Majesties’ Household,
the humble petition of <span class='fss'>MARY SACKVILLE</span>:</p>

<p class='c037'>That it having pleased ye Almighty to lay his afflicting
hand on your petitioner’s husband and her two small
children for a long time together, having nothing to live
upon but his own hands’ labour, which failing him during
his sickness all his family have suffered thereby and been
put to great straights and having received much of your
Honour’s charity, is now&nbsp;... [<em>illegible</em>] but hopes that
your Lordship will consider it is the hand of accident that
is hard upon her.</p>

<p class='c037'>Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your Honour
will be pleased to bestow something on her this time that
she may undergo her calamity with a little more cheerfulness
and alacrity.</p>

<p class='c042'>According to the will of this Mary Sackville, her
circumstances must have improved, for she leaves
£1000 “for the benefit of Katherine Sackville my
sister or reputed sister who was born of the body of
Mrs. Phillipa Waldgrave, deceased, my late mother or
reputed mother.” This will is dated 1684, so I should
think the Katherine Sackville referred to is probably
the “K. S.” who was buried at Withyham, aged
fourteen, in 1690—humble little initials among the
Lady Annes and Lady Elizabeths who surround her.
She had been provided for in Lord Dorset’s will also:</p>

<p class='c037'>To my natural daughter Katherine Sackville, <em>alias</em> Walgrave,
£1000.</p>

<p class='c037'>To my natural daughter Mary Sackville, <em>alias</em> Walgrave,
£200, and £2000 before settled on her.</p>

<p class='c037'>To my natural daughter An [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>] Lee, <em>alias</em> Sackville, the
sum of £500.</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>It thus seems probable that these daughters were the
children of two different mothers, Lee and Walgrave,
Waldgrave, Waldegrave, as it was variously spelt.
An agreement at Knole, dated 1674, provides for
Phillipa Walgrave to receive interest on £1000 placed
in Mr. Guy’s hands by Lord Dorset, the interest on
it to be paid to her yearly, and after her death to Mary
Sackville until her marriage or until the age of 21, but
if Mrs. Walgrave marries, the £1000 is to be paid to her.
Another natural daughter, also named Mary, married
Lord Orrery, but I do not know who was her mother.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ v</h3>

<p class='c048'>He had been one of the most notorious libertines of the
wild time which followed the Restoration. He had been the
terror of the city watch, had passed many nights in the
round house, and had at least once occupied a cell in Newgate.
His passion for Nell Gwyn, who always called him her
Charles the First, had given no small amusement and scandal
to the town. Yet, in the midst of follies and vices, his
courageous spirit, his fine understanding, and his natural
goodness of heart, had been conspicuous. Men said that the
excesses in which he indulged were common between him
and the whole race of gay young Cavaliers, but that his
sympathy with human suffering and the generosity with
which he made reparation to those whom his freaks had
injured were all his own. His associates were astonished by
the distinction which the public made between him and them.
“He may do what he chooses,” said Wilmot, “he is never
in the wrong.” The judgment of the world became still
more favourable to Dorset when he had been sobered by
time and marriage. His graceful manners, his brilliant conversation,
his soft heart, his open hand, were universally
praised. No day passed, it was said, in which some distressed
family had not reason to bless his name. And yet,
with all his good nature, such was the keenness of his wit
that scoffers whose sarcasm all the town feared stood in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>craven fear of the sarcasm of Dorset. All political parties
esteemed and caressed him, but politics were not much to his
taste. Had he been driven by necessity to exert himself, he
would probably have risen to the highest posts in the state;
but he was born to rank so high and to wealth so ample that
many of the motives which impel men to engage in public
affairs were wanting to him.... Like many other men
who, with great natural abilities, are constitutionally and
habitually indolent, he became an intellectual voluptuary,
and a master of all those pleasing branches of knowledge
which can be acquired without severe application. He was
allowed to be the best judge of painting, of sculpture, of
architecture, of acting, that the court could show. On
questions of polite learning his decisions were regarded at all
the coffee houses as without appeal. More than one clever
play which had failed on the first representation was supported
by his single authority against the whole clamour of
the pit and came forth successful at the second trial....</p>

<p class='c042'>Macaulay thus summarises his career and character,
and I am led quite naturally to the consideration of one
aspect of his life on which I have scarcely touched, and
that is his connection with the men of letters of his
day. The often-quoted saying, that Butler owed to
him that the court tasted his <cite>Hudibras</cite>, Wycherley
that the town liked his <cite>Plain Dealer</cite>, and that the Duke
of Buckingham deferred the publication of his
<cite>Rehearsal</cite> until he was sure that Lord Buckhurst would
not rehearse it upon him again—this saying had much
truth in it. It is better, I think, to quote the disinterested
opinion of Macaulay rather than the
panegyrics of Prior or Dryden, or any of the contemporary
authors who stood too greatly in Dorset’s
debt for complete impartiality:</p>

<p class='c037'>Such a patron of letters England had never seen [<em>says
Macaulay</em>]. His bounty was bestowed with equal judgment
and liberality, and was confined to no sect or faction. Men
of genius, estranged from each other by literary jealousy or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>difference of political opinion, joined in acknowledging his
impartial kindness. Dryden owned that he had been saved
from ruin by Dorset’s princely generosity. Yet Montague
and Prior, who had keenly satirised Dryden, were introduced
by Dorset into public life; and the best comedy of Dryden’s
mortal enemy, Shadwell, was written at Dorset’s country
seat. The munificent earl might, if such had been his wish,
have been the rival of those of whom he was content to be
the benefactor. For the verses which he occasionally composed,
unstudied as they are, exhibit the traces of a genius
which, assiduously cultivated, would have produced something
great. In the small volume of his works may be found
songs which have the easy vigour of Suckling, and little
satires which sparkle with wit as splendid as those of Butler.</p>

<p class='c042'>One can, perhaps, scarcely agree with Macaulay in this
estimate of Dorset’s literary gifts. The songs he wrote
are little more than easy specimens of conventional
Restoration verse, and, for my part, I fail to find in them,
with the exception of “To all you ladies now at land,”
any merit which was not shared by all the numerous
song-writers of the day. It certainly cannot be claimed
for him that he had any of the vigour, originality, or
true poetic impulse of his great-great-grandfather, the
old Lord Treasurer, and although it may be argued
that the age of Elizabeth and the age of the Restoration
differed totally in poetic conception and spontaneity,
I still do not admit that Dorset possessed those qualities
which might have made up in one direction for those
which were lacking in another, I have already quoted
his sea-song, unquestionably the best thing he ever
wrote, and, to give point to my argument, will quote
two further songs, which may stand as typical examples,
the first of his graceful but entirely artificial talent, the
second of his satire which caused Rochester to say of him:</p>

<p class='c042'>The fugitive character of his own verses does not,
however, in any way detract from his splendour as a
patron. It is well known that Matthew Prior as a boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>was found by him reading Horace in a tavern in Westminster,
when, struck by his intelligence, Dorset sent
the boy at his own expense to school until his election
as King’s Scholar. Prior in after years did not forget
this kindness. His poems are dedicated to the son of
his earliest patron, and there are, as students of Prior
will remember, several amongst them especially written
to members of Dorset’s family, notably the “Lines
to Lord Buckhurst [Dorset’s son] when playing with a
cat.” The many letters from Prior to Lord Dorset,
now in Lord Bath’s possession, testify to the endurance
of their friendship: one of these letters ends with a
poem, which I quote, as I am under the impression that
it is not included in any edition of Prior’s works:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Spare Dorset’s sacred life, discerning Fate,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And Death shall march through camps and courts in state,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Emptying his quiver on the vulgar great:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Round Dorset’s board let Peace and Plenty dance,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Far off let Famine her sad reign advance,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And War walk deep in blood through conquered France.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Apollo thus began the mystic strain,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>The Muses’ sons all bowed and said Amen.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'>It is perhaps less commonly known that Dryden also
owed, in another way, much to Dorset. The account is
thus given by Macaulay:</p>

<p class='c037'>Dorset became Lord Chamberlain, and employed his
influence and patronage annexed to his functions, as he had
long employed his private means, in encouraging genius and
alleviating misfortune. One of the first acts which he was
under the necessity of performing must have been painful to
a man of so generous a nature, and of so keen a relish for
whatever was excellent in arts and letters. Dryden could no
longer remain Poet Laureate. The public would not have
borne to see any papist among the servants of their Majesties;
and Dryden was not only a papist, but an apostate. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>had, moreover, aggravated the guilt of his apostacy by
calumniating and ridiculing the Church which he had deserted.
He had, it was facetiously said, treated her as the pagan
persecutors of old treated her children. He had dressed her
up in the skin of a wild beast, and then baited her for the
public amusement. He was removed; but he received
from the private bounty of the magnificent Chamberlain a
pension equal to the salary which had been withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c042'>Dryden, apparently, despite this generosity, continued
to lament his ill-fortune, and his contemporary Blackmore,
in a poem called <cite>Prince Arthur</cite>, satirises him in
the character of <cite>Laurus</cite> for his assiduity at Dorset’s
doors—Dorset being the <cite>Sakil</cite> of the poem, Sackville
in transparent disguise:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>The poets’ nation did obsequious wait</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>For the kind dole divided at his gate.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Laurus among the meagre crowd appeared,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>An old, revolted, unbelieving bard,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Who thronged, and shoved, and pressed, and would be heard.</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Sakil’s high roof, the Muses’ palace, rung</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>With endless cries, and endless songs he sung.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>To bless good Sakil Laurus would be first;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>But Sakil’s prince and Sakil’s God he cursed.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Sakil without distinction threw his bread,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Despised the flatterer, but the poet fed.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'>It is true that in his <cite>Essay on Satire</cite>, which, like his
<cite>Essay on Dramatic Poetry</cite>, is dedicated in terms of the
most outrageous flattery to Dorset, Dryden makes full
acknowledgement of the obligation:</p>

<p class='c036'>I must ever acknowledge, to the honour of your Lordship
and the eternal memory of your charity, that, since this
revolution, wherein I have patiently suffered the ruin of my
small fortune, and the loss of that poor subsistence which
I had from two kings, whom I had served more faithfully
than profitably to myself; then your Lordship was pleased, out
of no other motive but your own nobleness, without any desert
of mine, or the least solicitation from me, to make me a most
bountiful present, which at that time, when I was most in want
of it, came most seasonably and unexpectedly to my relief.</p>

<p class='c049'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>But I think there may be detected, even in this
acknowledgment, the note of whining to which
Macaulay, in the continuation of the passage I have
quoted, draws attention. It is also related that Dryden,
when dining with Dorset, found a hundred-pound note
hidden under his plate. In a letter preserved at Knole,
in Dryden’s beautiful handwriting, he makes further
acknowledgement, after proffering a petition on behalf of
a friend who wished to obtain rooms in Somerset House:</p>

<p class='c036'>... if I had confidence enough, my Lord, I would presume to
mind you of a favour which your Lordship formerly gave
me some hopes of from the Queen; but if it be not proper
or convenient for you to ask, I dare give your Lordship no
further trouble in it, being on so many other accounts already
your Lordship’s most obliged obedient servant,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'>We know that Dryden was a constant visitor at
Knole; we have even an anecdote of one of his visits.
It is related that someone proposed that each member
of the party should write an impromptu, and that
Dryden, when the allotted time had expired, should
judge between them. Silence ensued while each guest
wrote busily, or laboriously, upon the sheet of paper
provided: Dorset scribbled a couple of lines and threw
it down on the table. At the end of the time the umpire
rose, and said that after careful consideration he
awarded the prize to their host; he would read out
what his Lordship had written; it was: “I promise
to pay Mr. John Dryden or order five hundred pounds
on demand. DORSET.”</p>

<p class='c042'>It would be interesting to know who were the other
members of the party; perhaps Tom Durfey, perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Lady Dorset, who is described as “jeune, belle, riche,
et sage,” perhaps Rochester, whose portrait hangs in
the Poets’ Parlour—and I imagine the Poets’ Parlour
to have been the scene of this little incident, “a chamber
of parts and players,” says Horace Walpole, “which is
proper enough in that house”—a portrait of a young
man in a heavy wig, labelled “died repentant after a
profligate life,” as I, not understanding the long words,
used to gabble off to strangers along with other piteous
little shibboleths when showing the house. Certainly
Shadwell was not there, for he and Dryden were at
mortal enmity; Shadwell, his successor in the Laureateship,
another friend and protégé of Dorset’s, described
by Dryden as being</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>

      <div class='line'><em>For every inch that is not fool is rogue</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c049'>and who writes of Dorset that he was received by him
as a member of his family, and furthermore, rather
plaintively, in a letter at Knole, beseeching Lord
Dorset’s intervention, as “they have put Durfey’s play
before ours, and this day a play of Dryden’s is read to
them and that is to be acted before ours too.”</p>

<p class='c042'>Tom Durfey, whose portrait is upstairs in Lady
Betty’s room, painted in profile, with surely the most
formidable of all hooked noses, was almost a pensioner at
Knole, having his own rooms over the dairy, and is guilty
of these execrable verses in praise of his second home:</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c050'>The first duke of Dorset remains to me, in spite
of much reading, but an indistinct figure. I do
not know whether the fault is mine or his.
Perhaps he was a man of little personality; certainly
he was lacking in the charm of his scapegrace father or
of his frivolous great-nephew, the third duke. And yet
he is a personage of some solidity: weighty, Georgian
solidity. The epithets chosen by his contemporaries to
describe him are all concordant enough, “a man of
dignity, caution, and plausibility,” “worthy, honest,
good-natured,” “he preserved to the last the good
breeding, decency of manner, and dignity of exterior
deportment of Queen Anne’s time, never departing
from his style of gravity and ceremony,” “a large-grown,
full person,” and finally—the words come almost
with the shock of being precisely what we were
waiting for—“in spite of the greatest dignity in his
appearance, he was in private the greatest lover of low
humour and buffoonery.” He was fitted, if I piece
together rightly my scraps of evidence, to lead the life
of a country gentleman, performing his duty towards
his county, entertaining his friends, enjoying with them
after dinner the low humour to which he inclined,
rolling out his laughter in the Poets’ Parlour, slapping
his great thighs, and rejoining his wife afterwards in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the spirit of affectionate domesticity which induced
him to begin his letters to her “dear, dear, dear girl,”
or “my dear, dear Colly.” He lived, says one account
of him, after detailing his amiable qualities as a kind
husband and father, “in great hospitality all his life,
and he was so respected that when at Knole on
Sundays the front of the house was so crowded with
horsemen and carriages as to give it rather the appearance
of a princely levee than the residence of a private
nobleman.” It was his misfortune that he was not
allowed to remain leading this kind of life so much to
his taste: “the poor Duke of Dorset,” said Lord
Shelburne, “was made by his son to commence
politician at sixty.” The local offices which he held
were well suited to his disposition and abilities; the
titles of <em>Custos Rotulorum</em>, <em>Lord Lieutenant of Kent</em>,
<em>Constable of Dover Castle</em>, and <em>Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports</em> sit admirably upon his rather provincial
dignity. He could discharge these offices while surrounding
himself with friends, and keeping open house
at Knole. He was surely happy at Knole, with the
duchess and the duchess’ friend Lady Betty Germaine
installed in her two little rooms in a corner of the house,
and the correspondence with Dean Swift, and the
echoes of the Restoration reaching him in the shape of
dedications from Prior and Pope, who had been his
father’s friends. He must have been happy superintending
the building of the “ruins” in the park, in
ordering the removal of the clock from the roof of the
Great Hall to a safer place over Bourchier’s oriel, in
putting up the balustrade in the Stone Court, in adding
to the picture-gallery his own full-length Kneller,
painted in Garter robes—a dignified and ponderous
addition—in continuing his father’s kindly and contemptuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>patronage of Durfey, in entertaining the
Prince of Wales, in receiving the present of a pair of
elk-antlers measuring 7 foot from tip to tip, in playing
at cards with his wife and Lady Betty, in watching the
bull-baiting in the park, in inspiring the following
tribute on the occasion of his birthday:</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>It is true that certain discordant notes troubled from
time to time this Georgian harmony. The house-steward
killed the black page in the passage; and the
duke’s sons themselves were unsatisfactory; even the
favourite son, Lord George, who was the apple of his
father’s eye, fell into disgrace and was court-martialled
on a charge of disobedience and cowardice. “I always
told you,” said Lord John on hearing of this, “that
George was no better than myself.” This affair of the
battle of Minden must have been a heavy blow to the
duke, but although Lord George was not exonerated
he retained all his father’s doting affection. Still, the
mud had been slung at him and not a little had stuck.
The two other sons were a source of sorrow: Lord
John, after devoting his youth to cricket, went off his
head; and Lord Middlesex, the eldest of the three,
was an altogether deplorable character, prompting
these verses, based upon an old saying about the
family:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Folly and sense in Dorset’s race</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Alternately do run,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As Carey one day told his Grace</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Praising his eldest son.</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>But Carey must allow for once</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Exception to this rule,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>For Middlesex is but a dunce,</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>Though Dorset be a fool.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'>I quote the verses as they stand, though “dunce”
seems scarcely the right description to apply to Lord
Middlesex, that dissolute and extravagant man of
fashion, who squandered large sums of money upon
producing operas, that “proud, disgusted, melancholy,
solitary man,” whose conduct savoured so strongly of
madness. Certain family characteristics appeared in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>him which had skipped his father, and his father and
he, consequently and not unnaturally, were not on
very good terms. The duke, indeed, did not know
what to make of his eldest son and heir. “Upon my
word, Mr. Cary,” he said, when Mr. Cary asked him
loudly at the play whether Lord Middlesex was to
undertake the opera again next season, “I have not
considered what answer to make to such a question.”
Both Lord Middlesex and Lord John being so unsatisfactory,
Lord George was, and remained, his
father’s favourite. Lord George, in an even greater
degree than his father, is an incongruity among the
Sackvilles, a departure from type. In spite of all his
mistakes, his misjudgments, and his misfortunes, he
was a man of greater ability than most of them, of
greater energy than the common run of his indolent
and pleasure-loving race, of a further-reaching
ambition. He did not begin life as the eldest son,
coming in due course to be the head of the family,
and languidly accepting the civil or diplomatic posts
which were pressed upon him; such career as he had
he made for himself. Unlike his predecessors or their
descendants, he was neither an ambassador, a poet,
nor a patron of art or letters—“I have not,” he wrote,
“genius sufficient for works of <em>mere imagination</em>”—but
first a soldier and then a statesman, both disastrously.
It is not my intention to go into the details of his public
career; my ignorance is too great of the tangle of
Georgian politics; nor am I qualified to discuss whether
he did or did not disobey his orders at Minden,
whether he was or was not largely responsible for the
loss of America, whether he did or did not write the
<em>Letters of Junius</em>; such questions are treated in
histories of the period. Nor can I deal with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>enormous number of letters on political subjects written
both by and to Lord George: I have looked into them
more than once, and have come away merely bewildered
by the cross-threads of home politics, by the names of
remembered or forgotten statesmen, by the fall and
reconstruction of Ministries, by the crises of Whigs
and Tories. So I judge it best to leave Lord George
alone, “hot, haughty, ambitious, and obstinate, a sort
of melancholy in his look which runs through all the
Sackville family,” and to seek neither to blacken nor to
whitewash his character. I scarcely regard him as one
of the Sackvilles, perhaps because he broke away from
the family traditions into unfamiliar paths, perhaps
also because he earned his own peerage, inherited a
large house of his own, and led an existence separate
from Knole. Living at Knole among its portraits and
its legends which grew into the very texture of one’s
life, it was, I suppose, inevitable that one should grow
up with pre-conceived affections or indifferences, and
for some reason Lord George never awakened my
interest or my sense of relationship. He was a public
character, not a relation.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c044'>The early impressions of the first duke, who grew
to be so pompous, stout, and good-natured, and whose
three sons gave him in their several ways so much
anxiety, are not unattractive. There is a picture of him
as a little slim boy, with his sister and their pet fawn;
and there is Lord George’s own anecdote of his father’s
childhood:</p>

<p class='c037'>My father, having lost his own mother, was brought up
chiefly by the Dowager Countess of Northampton, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>grandmother. She being particularly acceptable to Queen
Mary, that Princess commanded her always to bring her
little grandson, Lord Buckhurst, to Kensington Palace,
though at that time hardly four years of age, and he was
allowed to amuse himself with a child’s cart in the gallery.
King William, like almost all Dutchmen, never failed to
attend the tea-table every evening. It happened that her
Majesty having one afternoon by his desire made tea, and
waiting for the King’s arrival, who was engaged on business
in his cabinet at the other extremity of the gallery, the boy,
hearing the Queen express her impatience at the delay, ran
away to the closet, dragging after him the cart. When he
arrived at the door, he knocked, and the King asking “Who
is there?” “Lord Buck,” answered he. “And what does
Lord Buck want with me?” replied his Majesty. “You
must come to tea directly,” said he, “the Queen is waiting
for you.” King William immediately laid down his pen and
opened the door. Then taking the child in his arms, he
placed Lord Buckhurst in the cart, and seizing the pole
drew them both along the gallery to the room in which were
seated the Queen, Lady Northampton, and the company.
But no sooner had he entered the apartment, than, exhausted
with the effort, which had forced the blood upon his lungs,
and being constitutionally asthmatic, he threw himself into
a chair, and for some minutes was incapable of uttering a
word, breathing with the utmost difficulty. The Countess of
Northampton, shocked at the consequences of her grandson’s
indiscretion, would have punished him, but the King
intervened on his behalf.</p>

<p class='c042'>When a young man he went on the inevitable
Grand Tour. This journey, it is fair to assume, which
was taken at the instigation of his mother’s relations,
was designed to keep him away from the influence of
his enfeebled father and of his step-mother, Ann
Roche, quite as much as for the benefit of his education.
His father was very angry at this withdrawal
of his son from his authority, and wrote to him:</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>i hear my Lady Northampton has ordered you not to obey
me; if you take any notice of what she says i have enough
in my power to make you suffer for it beyond what she will
make you amends for. But i cannot imagine you to be such a
fool as to be governed by the passion and folly of anybody.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c038'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your affectionate father,</div>
      <div class='line in24'>DORSET.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>i expect you will come away by the next yocht.</p>

<p class='c042'>The next yacht, however, came away without Lord
Buckhurst, and the young man did not return to
England until after his father’s death. Shortly after his
succession and return he married Elizabeth Colyear, his
“dear, dear Colly,” and was appointed Lord Warden
of the Cinque Ports at a salary of £160 a year, and
Lieutenant of Dover Castle at £50. This is the menu
and cost of the dinner given by the youthful Lord
Warden at Dover Castle on the 16th August 1709 on
his being appointed by Queen Anne:</p>

<p class='c042'>This was an office he held intermittently for many
years, and on one occasion, England being then at war
with Spain, two hundred and fifty butts, eight hogsheads,
and fifty quarter casks of Spanish mountain wine,
and one hundred jars of Raisins of the Sun, being
washed up at Deal and Sandwich, they were adjudged
to him as the Lord Warden’s perquisite of flotsam and
jetsam.</p>

<p class='c042'>In 1714 died Queen Anne, and Lord Dorset, with
others, was sent to Hanover to announce to George his
accession to the English throne. He returned from
Hanover with the new King, and drove with him in his
coach from Greenwich to London. On the way
George related that thirty-three years earlier he had
travelled to England as a suitor for the hand of Queen
Anne: returning to Gravesend after the failure of his
mission, he rode a common post-horse, which gave him
a fall, so that he arrived at Gravesend covered with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>mud. The King amused himself in the coach with
looking out for the place where this misfortune had
come upon him, and pointed it out to Lord Dorset,
who no doubt joined politely in the laughter.</p>

<p class='c042'>Thus began that curious reign of a King who did not
know the language of his adopted country, who spent
as much time in his Hanoverian as in his English
estates, and infinitely preferred them, who surrounded
himself with German courtiers and mistresses, and who
locked up his wife for two-and-thirty years as a punishment
for her infidelity. The solemnity of Lord Dorset
cannot have been out of place in such a court. Honours
now crowded rapidly upon him, although at one
moment he was temporarily deprived of all his offices
for taking part in political intrigues. He was made a
Knight of the Garter, six years later he was made a
duke, he was given the office of Lord Steward, and
finally he entered upon the first lap of his unfortunate
career as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Before this,
however, he was for the second time called upon to be
the bearer of news of accession to a King of England.
I give the account in Lord George’s words:</p>

<p class='c037'>When the intelligence of his [George I’s] decease, which
took place near Osnabrugh, in the end of July 1727, arrived
in London, the Cabinet having immediately met, thought
proper to dispatch the Duke of Dorset with the news to the
Prince of Wales. He then resided at Kew, in a state of great
alienation from the King, the two Courts maintaining no
communication. Some little time being indispensable to
enable my father to appear in a suitable manner before the
new monarch, he sent forward the Duchess his wife, in order
to announce the event. She arrived at Kew just as the Prince,
according to his invariable custom, having undressed himself
after dinner, had laid down in bed. The Duchess demanding
permission to see him immediately, on business of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>greatest importance, the servants acquainted the Princess of
Wales with her arrival; and the Duchess, without a moment’s
hesitation, informed her Royal Highness, that George the
First lay dead at Osnabrugh, that the Cabinet had ordered
her husband to be the bearer of the intelligence to his
successor, and that the Duke would follow her in a short
time. She added that not a moment should be lost in communicating
so great an event to the Prince, as the Ministers
wished him to come up to London that same evening, in
order to summon a Privy Council, to issue a proclamation,
and take other requisite measures, at the commencement of
a new reign.</p>

<p class='c037'>To the propriety of all these steps the Princess assented;
but at the same time informed the Duchess, that she could
not venture to enter her husband’s room, as he had only just
taken off his clothes and composed himself to sleep. “Besides,”
added she, “the Prince will not give credit to the
intelligence, but will exclaim that it is a fabrication, designed
for the purpose of exposing him.” The Duchess continued
nevertheless to remonstrate with her Royal Highness, on the
injurious consequences of losing time, and adding that the
Duke of Dorset would expect to find the Prince not only
apprised of it, but ready to accompany him to London. The
Princess of Wales took off her shoes, opened the chamber
door softly, and advanced up to the bedside, while my
mother remained at the threshold, till she should be allowed
to enter the apartment. As soon as the Princess came near
the bed, a voice from under the clothes cried out in German,
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was ist das?</span></i> “I am come, sir,” answered she, “to
announce to you the death of the King, which has taken
place in Germany.” “That is one damned trick,” returned
the Prince, “I do not believe one word of it.” “Sir,” said
the Princess, “it is most certain. The Duchess of Dorset
has just brought the intelligence, and the Duke will be here
immediately. The Ministers hope that you will repair to town
this very evening, as your presence there is indispensable.”
Her Royal Highness then threw herself on her knees, to
kiss the new King’s hand; and beckoning to the Duchess of
Dorset to advance, she came in likewise, knelt down, and
assured him of the indisputable truth of his father’s decease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Convinced at length of the fact, he consented to get up and
dress himself. The Duke of Dorset arriving in his coach and
six, almost immediately afterwards, George the Second
quitted Kew the same evening for London.</p>

<p class='c042'>George the Second, as Prince of Wales, had been on
terms of personal friendship with the duke. He had
stayed at Knole, when half an ox, four sheep, and a
calf were provided, besides the following items for his
visit:</p>

<p class='c042'>The duke’s first essay in Ireland was not unsuccessful:
he left affairs alone as far as he possibly could
and was tolerably popular. It was only the second
time, twenty years later, that he and Lord George
incurred so much dislike. Into the political reasons
for this I have already said that I will not, because
I cannot, enter; I will only quote from a curious
lampoon, preserved in the British Museum, which
was written to celebrate the duke’s departure in

is at Knole; that an old play-bill of hers was found
behind the panelling in the Great Hall; that the duke
gave her a command performance at Dublin; and,
finally, that the following facetious petition—was it
written by one of the duke’s disrespectful sons?—is
among the Knole papers:</p>

shewing her zeal for his Majesty’s service by her ready
acceptance and faithful discharge of any employment he
shall graciously please to bestow upon her.</p>

<p class='c037'>That her friends have been at great expense and trouble
in procuring and perusing the list of the several places on
this establishment, and find her extremely well qualified to
discharge the Office of Housekeeper to his Majesty’s Castle
as it doth not require much greater ability than the Rolls or
the Chancellorship of the Exchequer.</p>

<p class='c037'>That your Memorialist is a true friend to the present
Constitution in opposition to all Mock Patriots and drinks
the Brownlow Majority and the Minority for the Money-bill
every day devoutly.</p>

<p class='c037'>That she has already by the assistance of whisky made
two considerable Proselytes Patrick O’Donoghoe and Thady
Foley her Chairman tho’ one of them had been closeted by
Col. Dilkes and the other taken by the hand by Sir Rich<sup>d</sup>
Cox, and verily believes if the same means were employed,
the Opposition would soon lose its principal supporters.</p>

<p class='c037'>That your Memorialist can produce two of the greatest
Polemical Writers of the present Age in support of her
character, 1st. Peter Willson who has abused her more
than once in his <cite>Universal Advertiser</cite>—an honour which he
is never known to confer on any but persons of the first ranks
and character. 2<sup>dly</sup> Geo. Faulkner, in whose impartial
Journal are contained a Score of Poems, One Dozen of
Sonnets, Six letters from some of the best Critics, if you will
take their own words for it, four Epigrams, besides occasional
paragraphs, all composed in her praise, and which
are at least as well written as they are printed.</p>

<p class='c037'>That your Memorialist is little versed in the Housekeeper’s
Arithmetic, having never been instructed in the
doctrine of Items, Dittos, Sums Total and Balances, which
circumstance, it is conceived, will turn out greatly to the
advantage of the Government.</p>

<p class='c037'>That her personal attachment to your Grace is so well
known, that odd reports have been raised in relation to some
intimacies that have past between two persons that shall be
nameless, and which she defies her adversaries to prove.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Wherefore she humbly hopes that Your Grace will take
the premises into your serious consideration, and oblige the
present Incumbent to resign the said office, your Memorialist
paying her the full value thereof, or if she continues obstinate
as old women are apt to do, and refuses to sell, that the
reversion may be granted to your Petitioner, and the rather
as she conceives, if it be not done under your Grace’s
administration, there may be some reason to fear it will never
be done at all.</p>

Housekeeper is in no manner qualified to do.</p>

<p class='c044'>I have already mentioned Lady Betty Germaine,
who, during the lifetime of the first duke and duchess,
lived almost entirely at Knole and had three rooms—her
bedroom, her sitting-room, and her china closet—set
aside for her exclusive use. This little prim lady, to
whom the three little rooms must have provided so
apposite a frame, occupied her time in writing letters,
in stitching at crewel work with brightly-coloured
wools, in making pot-pourri to fill the bowls on the
window ledges, and in telling anecdotes of Queen
Anne, whose lady-in-waiting she had once been, since
to her, no doubt, in common with all human nature,
the days which were the past were preferable to the
days which were the present. She was, primarily, the
friend of the Duchess of Dorset, and for once a woman
was installed in the house whose coiffure and petticoats
the wind of scandal was unable to ruffle. They composed
she, the duchess, the duke, and Lord George, a
harmonious quartette, whose correspondence survives,
voluminous and intimate, pricked into sharper highlights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>here and there by the pen of Swift. “As to my
duchess,” writes Lady Betty, “she is so reserved that
perhaps she may not be at first so much admired.”
The duke she thought “great-souled,” and it must
have been an occasion of great distress to her that her
friend Swift should not always share her views:</p>

<p class='c037'>Madam [<em>he writes to her after failing to obtain some
favour from Dorset</em>], I owe your Ladyship the acknowledgement
of a letter I have long received, relating to a request
I made to my Lord Duke. I now dismiss you, Madam,
from your office of being a go-between upon any affair I
might have with his Grace. I will never more trouble him,
either with my visits or application. His business in this
kingdom is to make himself easy; his lessons are all prescribed
for him from Court; and he is sure, at a very cheap
rate, to have a majority of most corrupt slaves and idiots
at his devotion. The happiness of this Kingdom is of no
more consequence to him than it would be to the Great
Mogul....</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LADY BETTY GERMAINE<br /><br /><em>From the portrait at Knole by</em> <span class='sc'>C. Phillips</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>One wonders whether such suggestions troubled
Lady Betty. Was it possible that her great-souled
friend would not be Lord Steward and Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Warden and Lord
Lieutenant of Kent, did he not also happen to be Duke
of Dorset? Was it possible that people such as the
Sackvilles occasionally occupied positions due to their
birth rather than to their intellect? Was it true that
he, and particularly Lord George, cared for their own
advancement rather than for the credit of England?—they
who <em>were</em> England, who shared the blood of
the Tudors and the Howards and the Spencers and the
Cliffords? whose house was quarried from Kentish
rock? whose oaks and beeches were rooted so deep
into the soil of England? Lady Betty herself, who as
Lady Betty Berkeley had come from that most ancient
castle—that rose-and-grey castle, the colour of her
own dried rose-leaves, the castle that, squat, romantic,
and uncouth, brooded over the Severn across the
meadows of Gloucestershire—Lady Betty herself was
of all people least qualified or likely to criticize. The
household at Knole was ordered on a magnificent
scale, with the duke and duchess and their guest at the
apex of the pyramid which reposed on the base of five
servants at £20 each, two at £15, two at £10 10<em>s.</em>,
seven at £10, two at £8, thirteen at £6, eight at £5,
two at £5, one at £2, besides the chaplain who was
unsalaried, the senior officers, the Steward, the Comptroller,
and the Master of the Horse at £60, £30, and
£25 respectively, Tom Durfey living over the dairy,
and the rabble of labourers, gardeners, and what-not,
of whom nobody took any notice. This was life as
Lady Betty was accustomed to find it ordered. If ever
she paused to question its system, no trace of her
wondering appears in her letters.</p>

<p class='c042'>She had a house of her own, Drayton, in Northamptonshire,
considered by Horace Walpole a “venerable
heap of ugliness, with many curious bits,” which she
had inherited from her late husband, who in his turn
had inherited it from a first wife. This husband of
Lady Betty’s is a peculiar figure; so peculiar, indeed,
so ambiguous, and so equivocal, that one wonders at
his alliance with the orderly Lady Betty Berkeley,
unless this may be explained by the fact that he
“possessed a very handsome person, and was always a
distinguished favourite of the other Sex.” He was,
I gather, a soldier of fortune, of uncertain parentage,
or, as Lord George Sackville delicately puts it,
“believed to stand in a very close degree of consanguinity
to King William the Third.” William, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>any rate, brought him over to England from Holland
in 1688, knighted him, saw to it that he became a
member of the House of Commons, and assisted him
with grants of money; and Germaine, who inherited
from his father no armorial bearings, was accustomed
to use a red cross, which might be taken to mean that
his actual was higher than his ostensible birth. This
gentleman combined with the instincts of a collector
a profound ignorance of artistic matters. His principal
pride was his collection of “Rarities,” in which he
would exhibit the dagger of Henry VIII; he believed
a certain Sir Matthew Germaine to be the author of
St. Matthew’s Gospel; and at Drayton, where he was
building a colonnade, he caused the columns to be
placed upside down, as he had mistaken the capitals for
the pedestals.</p>

<p class='c042'>This was the man who married Lady Betty Berkeley
when she was thirty years younger than himself. He
had previously been married to the Duchess of Norfolk,
whose husband divorced her on Sir John Germaine’s
account. After her death, by which he inherited
Drayton, he attached himself to the Duke and Duchess
of Dorset, who received him with their wonted hospitality;
but this was not enough: he wanted a
brilliant alliance, he wanted an heir to Drayton. While
at Bristol he “cast his eyes upon Lady Betty, whose
birth, character, and accomplishments rendered her
every way worthy of his choice.” They married; and
the friendship with the Dorsets, to whom Lady Betty
was already devoted, was strengthened by the new
bond. Although the difference in age was so considerable,
Lady Betty, through her “superior understanding,
added to the most correct deportment,
acquired great influence over him,” and when after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>twelve years of marriage Sir John died, “a martyr to
the gout as well as to other diseases,” he called his
wife to his bedside and spoke to her in these terms:</p>

<p class='c037'>Lady Betty [<em>said he</em>], I have made you a very indifferent
husband, and particularly of late years, when infirmities
have rendered me a burden to myself, but I shall not be much
longer troublesome to you. I advise you never again to
marry an old man, but I strenuously exhort you to marry
when I am gone, and I will endeavour to put it in your power.
You have fulfilled every obligation towards me in an exemplary
manner, and I wish to demonstrate my sense of your
merits. I have, therefore, by my will, bequeathed you this
estate, which I received from my first wife; and which,
as she gave to me, so I leave to you. I hope you will marry
and have children to inherit it. But, if events should determine
otherwise, it would give me pleasure to think that
Drayton descended after your decease to a younger son of
my friend the Duchess of Dorset.</p>

<p class='c042'>He then passed away, but in one particular Lady
Betty did not take his advice: she never married again,
although she survived him by fifty years, and thus it is
perhaps that I regard her, with her crewel work, her
china closet, and her pot-pourri, rather as a spinster
than as a widow. There is no trace at all at Knole of
Sir John Germaine, that royal bastard, that handsome
and enterprising child of fortune, thanks to whom
Drayton came into the possession of Lord George and
continues to this day in the hands of his descendants.
Of Lady Betty, on the other hand, there are copious
traces. There are her rooms, which I have already
described in the first chapter, her small square four-poster,
her ring-box, and the painted wooden figure
of a lady with the <em>fontange</em> of Queen Anne’s day on her
head. There is Lady Betty’s own portrait, a miniature
full-length, in blue brocade. There is yard upon yard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>her industrious embroidery. There is the pot-pourri
which is made every summer from her receipt (1750):</p>

<p class='c037'>Gather dry, Double Violets, Rose Leaves, Lavender,
Myrtle flowers, Verbena, Bay leaves, Rosemary, Balm,
Musk, Geranium. Pick these from the stalks and dry on
paper in the sun for a day or two before putting them in a
jar. This should be a large white one, well glazed, with a
close fitting cover, also a piece of card the exact size of the
jar, which you must keep pressed down on the flowers. Keep
a new wooden spoon to stir the salt and flowers from the
bottom, before you put in a fresh layer of bay salt above and
below every layer of flowers. Have ready of spices, plenty of
Cinnamon, Mace, Nutmeg, and Pepper and Lemon-peel
pounded. For a large jar ½ lb. Orris root, 1 oz. Storax, 1 oz.
Gum Benjamin, 2 ozs. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Calamino Aromatico</span>,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c020'><sup>[12]</sup></a> 2 grs. Musk,
and a small quantity of oil of Rhodium. The spice and gums
to be added when you have collected all the flowers you
intend to put in. Mix all well together, press it down well,
and spread bay salt on the top to exclude the air until the
January or February following. Keep the jar in a cool, dry
place.</p>

<p class='c042'>In the second respect Lady Betty carried out her
husband’s wishes, for when she died herself at the age
of nearly ninety she bequeathed the “venerable heap
of ugliness” to Lord George, with £20,000 and half
the residue of her estate.</p>

Duke of Dorset. He died a few years before his dear,
dear Colly, and was succeeded by his son, that Lord
Middlesex to whom I have alluded as being so unsatisfactory.
There is not much record of this good-for-nothing
duke, who enjoyed his dukedom only four
years, and who was married to a “very short, very
plain, very yellow, and vain girl, full of Greek and
Latin.” Apparently he married her no earlier than he
need, for Horace Walpole writes of “Lord Middlesex’s
wedding, which was over a week before it was known.
I believe the bride told it then, for he and all his family
are so silent that they would never have mentioned it;
she might have popped out a child, before a single Sackville
would have been at the expense of a syllable to
justify her.” I have already quoted the few epithets I
have found relating to this duke, the “proud, disgusted,
melancholy, solitary man&nbsp;...” who produced operas
and spent enormous sums on defending singers in legal
actions. He was reputed mad, “a disorder which there
was too much reason to suppose, ran in the blood”;
he was certainly eccentric; and there is a large picture
of him in the ball-room at Knole dressed as a Roman
emperor, with bare knees, a plumed helmet on his head,
and various pieces of armour. Besides these scanty
documents, there are some verses which scarcely
entitle him to be called a poet: <em>Arno’s Vale</em>, which
I have never read, and which is addressed to a certain
Madame Muscovita, whose portrait is at Knole; and
others which are at Knole, for instance:</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c050'>The portrait by Gainsborough in the ball-room
is of a man with a curved mouth, deep grey
eyes, and powdered hair brushed back off his
forehead. He looks out from the oval of his framing,
beautiful and melancholy. “I have always looked on
him as the most dangerous of men,” said the Duchess
of Devonshire, “for with that beauty of his he is so
unaffected, and has a simplicity and a persuasion in his
manner that makes one account very easily for the
number of women he has had in love with him.”
There is much in him which recalls his forefather,
Charles, the Dorset of the Restoration, but this is a
personality less opulent, less voluminous, more wistful
and more romantic; all his accessories are essentially
of the eighteenth century—his Chinese page, his
diamonds, his scarf-pin, his Italian mistress who caused
so much scandal by dancing at the Opera in Paris with
his Garter bound about her forehead. He is the immediate
precursor of the generation which replaced by
Gothic the Tudor windows in the Orangery, made
serpentine some of the straight paths in the garden,
and decorated the windows in the Colonnade with
representations of knights in full armour. He himself
escaped the baronial tendencies. He belonged to an
age more delicate, more exquisite; an age of quizzing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>glasses, of flowered waistcoats, of buckled shoes, and
of slim bejewelled swords. When he had his mistress
sculpted, it was lying full-length on a couch, naked
save for a single rose looping up her hair. When he
had her drawn, it was pointing her little foot in the
first step of a dance, a tambourine in her hand, and the
Chinese boy in the background. When he wrote to his
friends, it was in a bored, nonchalant style, half in
English and half in French. His manner was “soft,
quiet, and ingratiating.” He treated the women who
loved him with an easy heartlessness which failed to
diminish their affection. He was possessed of no very
great talents but those calculated to render life agreeable
to him in the circles into which he was born, for
it was his good fortune to be born handsome, rich,
charming, and a duke, in a century when those
qualifications were a certain passport to success.</p>

<p class='c042'>John Frederick Sackville became Duke of Dorset at
the age of twenty-four. He was the son of that Lord
John Sackville who passes across the annals of the family
early in life as a poet and cricketer, and later as a sad
and shabby figure, “always dirtily clad,” living under
mild restraint at Vevey, a victim to melancholia. There
was, however, no hint as yet of this hereditary strangeness
of temper in his son, the new Duke of Dorset. The
young man came brilliantly into his new possessions,
paid the undertaker £66 6<em>s.</em> for the late duke’s funeral,
paid the Sheriff £418 2<em>s.</em> for “things taken at Knole”—from
which it would seem that the late duke had
died in debt—bought four thousand ounces of silver,
and entertained his neighbours and tenantry to a feast
in celebration of his succession, at which sixty stone
of beef, mutton, and veal were consumed, thirty-four
pounds of wax-lights used, and musicians provided. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>is curious to see how the price of wine had altered
between the days of Charles II and this time; namely,
1769. Claret now cost 54<em>s.</em> a dozen, Burgundy 60<em>s.</em>
a dozen, Champagne 97<em>s.</em> a dozen, and port for the
servants’ table cost 20<em>s.</em> a dozen, in comparison with
the few shillings paid per gallon a century earlier.
The only thing which did not [<em>see</em> p. <a href='#Page_133'>133</a>] alter in
proportion is beer, for which 35<em>s.</em> a hogshead was paid
in the seventeenth century and £2 10<em>s.</em> a hogshead
in the eighteenth. The young duke’s time, we are told,
was “devoted to gallantry and pleasure among the
fashionable circles as well in France and Italy as in
England,” a phrase which begins to acquire a fatally
familiar ring through the generations of the family.
Perhaps nothing else could reasonably be expected of
him. Life offered him too great an ease and too many
advantages; why should he have rejected them?
Before he had been for a year in the enjoyment of his
honours and estates he had set out on the Grand Tour
accompanied by the celebrated Nancy Parsons and a
train of singers, actors, and Bohemians, who clustered
round him in every European capital which he visited.
Echoes of his extravagance and his escapades come
down to us from Paris and from Rome. He entertained
lavishly every evening, inviting only those who
could amuse his already blasé appetite; he rescued his
Nancy Parsons in the nick of time as she was about
to be abducted from a masked ball by a noble Venetian;
he indulged his taste for the fine arts “even
beyond the limits of his fortune”; he bought a
Perugino, he bought a doubtful Titian, and a number
of Italian primitives; he bought from a Mr. Jenkins in
Rome “<em>the figure of Demosthenes in the act of delivering
an oration</em>, a fine Grecian relick in marble,” and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>bronze cast of the Gladiator Repellens, on whose shield
he caused his own coat-of-arms to be embossed. This
kind of existence he continued to lead for two or three
years, when he threw over Nancy Parsons, returned to
England, and became the lover of a Mrs. Elizabeth
Armistead. Meanwhile, it appears from his account-books
that large sums were being spent by his orders
on both outdoor and indoor repairs at Knole. He put
down new floors, altered some of the windows, and
bought further enormous quantities of silver, 5920
ounces in one year alone, costing £2463 17<em>s.</em> 7<em>d.</em>, and
including a hundred and forty-four silver plates, eight
dozen each of forks and spoons, dishes of all kinds,
covers, and tureens. Occupied with Knole, love affairs,
and cricket, he dawdled away a particularly gilded
youth. Details from his account-books give a good
idea of his expenses and occupations:</p>

<p class='c042'>Mrs. Elizabeth Armistead reigned for three years,
but the duke had other diversions in other circles: the
gay, frivolous, and wanton Lady Betty Hamilton,
trailing from ball to ball with her suitors in her wake,
set her heart upon him, and he, not unresponsive, was
ready to trifle so long as he was not expected to marry.
Lady Betty was finally married off to Lord Derby,
reputed the ugliest and the richest peer in England.</p>

<p class='c037'>Many were the means employed till Lord Derby’s constant
and assiduous care veiled the ugliness of his person
before the idol he worshipped. Time and despair made Lady
Betty give a hasty and undigested consent. After a day of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>persecutions from every quarter, while a hair-dresser was
adorning her unhappy head, she traced the consent with a
pencil on a scrap of paper, and sent it wet with her tears
to her mother.</p>

<p class='c042'>A re-shuffle now took place: the duke became the new
Lady Derby’s lover, and Lord Derby became the lover
of Mrs. Armistead. This arrangement, however, was
not of long duration. Lord Derby fell in love with
Elizabeth Farren; Lady Derby, it was rumoured, ran
away and had to be brought back by her brother, the
Duke of Hamilton: still bent upon marrying the Duke
of Dorset, she wished to divorce Lord Derby, but was
foiled by the prudence of Miss Farren. The gossips of
London were much excited by all these occurrences.
Lady Sarah Lennox wrote: “It is no scandal to tell
you it is imagined that the Duke of Dorset will marry
Lady Derby. I am told she has been and still is most
thoroughly attached to him.” It would be satisfactory
to know exactly what part Dorset played; I fear not a
very creditable one. Lady Derby was an impulsive,
headstrong, attractive creature, capable of real passion
under all her lightheartedness and easy virtue;
her husband was unfaithful to her; her rival more sage
and experienced than she herself; her lover ready to
take what he could without incurring an irksome
responsibility. My grandfather’s sister, Lady Derby,
used to show at Knowsley the window through which
the Duke of Dorset was reported to have been admitted
to the house, disguised as a gardener, and it was commonly
supposed that the infant Lady Elizabeth Stanley
was in reality the duke’s daughter. But when the affair
threatened to become too serious he was only too ready
to resume his travels abroad.</p>

<p class='c042'>I can only suppose that it was during one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>absences that Horace Walpole went to Knole and
found it not at all to his liking, for he draws a picture
of the place in a state of desertion which would surely
not have been warranted had the duke and his household
been in occupation:</p>

<p class='c037'>I came to Knole [<em>he writes to Lady Ossory</em>], and that was
a medley of various feelings! Elizabeth and Burleigh and
Buckhurst; and then Charles [<em>he means Richard</em>] and
Anne, Dorset and Pembroke, and Sir Edward Sackville, and
then a more engaging Dorset, and Villiers and Prior, and
then the old duke and duchess, and Lady Betty Germaine,
and the court of George II.</p>

<p class='c037'>The place is stripped of its beeches and honours, and has
neither beauty nor prospects. The house, extensive as it is,
seemed dwindled to the front of a college, and has the silence
and solitude of one. It wants the cohorts of retainers, and
the bustling jollity of the old nobility, to disperse the gloom.
I worship all its faded splendour, and enjoy its preservation,
and could have wandered over it for hours with satisfaction,
but there was such a heterogenous housekeeper as poisoned
all my enthusiasm. She was more like one of Mrs. St. John’s
Abigails than an inhabitant of a venerable mansion, and
shuffled about in slippers, and seemed to <em>admire</em> how I could
care about the pictures of such old <em>frights</em> as covered the
walls.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c044'>I have said that cricket as well as love affairs occupied
the duke’s time, and in this he was only carrying
on the tradition begun by his father and his uncle, who
were both enthusiastic cricketers and took part in the
first match recorded as having been played at Sevenoaks,
in 1734, between Kent and Sussex, Lord John
Sackville and Lord Middlesex playing, of course, for
Kent. Six years later Sevenoaks played London on the
famous Vine cricket ground at Sevenoaks—the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>match recorded on the Vine. The young Duke of
Dorset inherited his father’s taste, keeping in his
employ professional cricketers such as Bowra, Miller,
and Minskull, and we have endless details of the
matches played, an old print of one match taking
place on the Vine between the duke’s men and Sir
Horace Mann’s men, which shows the players all wearing
jockey-caps and finally a number of cricketing
ballads, more noticeable for their enthusiasm than for
their excellence:</p>

      <div class='line'><em>Nor peevish seeks for victory,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And far unlike the modern way</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Of blocking every ball at play,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>He firmly stands with bat upright</em></div>

      <div class='line'><em>And scores six notches for the deed.</em></div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c042'>There is in particular a great contest between Kent

</div>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Despite the efforts of the duke and the men of Kent, they

      <div class='line in2'><em>Of such account as he.”</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c042'>It is satisfactory to learn that in the return match
Surrey was beaten.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>

<p class='c044'>We come now to the period when “the gay Duke
of Dorset became ambassador in Paris,” and “his
encouragement of the Parisian ballet was the amazement
and envy of his age.” It is entertaining, and
rather sad, to read both his official despatches from
Paris and his private letters to his friends, and to reflect
that while he was writing to the Duchess of Devonshire,
“I suppose you will hear talk of my ball, it has made
a great noise at Paris”; or to the Foreign Office, “It is
hardly possible to conceive a moment of more perfect
tranquility than the present, the French government,
free from the late causes of its anxiety, appears entirely
bent upon improving the advantages of peace,”—it
is sad, and certainly ironical, to reflect that the taking
of the Bastille was distant by a paltry three years.
With no foreboding of those tremendous events,
which more than any war, more even than the
career of Napoleon, were to change the fortunes of
humanity, the Court of France and the English envoy
continued on their course of enjoyment. The Duke of
Dorset became, naturally, extremely popular in Paris.
He was himself not sure that he wholly liked the
French:</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>All the French are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aimable, si vous voulez</span></i>, but they are
capricious and inconstant, especially the women [<em>he wrote
home to the Duchess of Devonshire</em>]; in short, I have really no
friend here but Mrs. B. [Marie Antoinette], and then I see
her so seldom that I forget half what I want to say to her.
The Frenchmen are all jealous and treacherous, so that
between the capriciousness of the fair sex and the want of
confidence I have in the other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je me sens vraiment malheureux</span></i>,
I assure you, my dearest duchess.</p>

<p class='c042'>But the French had no corresponding fault to find.
The English ambassador was princely and lavish; he
was spending money, as he himself owned, at the rate
of £11,000 a year; he was greatly in the Queen’s
favour, so greatly that he has been included by certain
authorities (notably Tilly) in their lists of her lovers.
Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who, although an inaccurate
was yet a contemporary writer, says that this was not
so, and that he has seen a letter-case, preserved by the
duke, full of Marie Antoinette’s notes addressed to
him. Wraxall says that they were written on private
concerns, commissions that she requested him to
execute for her, principally regarding English articles
of dress or ornament, and other innocent and unimportant
matters. Whether Dorset was or was not
her lover is not of the smallest importance; and surely
no one would grudge, at this distance of time, any
pleasure that a princess so young and so unfortunate
might have enjoyed in life.</p>

<p class='c042'>A question in which the Duke was naturally much
interested was the affair of the diamond necklace.
His despatches to the Foreign Office are full of
references to the story, from August 1785 onwards:</p>

<p class='c037'>The usually credited account is, that the Cardinal [de
Rohan] has forged an order from the Queen to the Jeweller
of the Crown to deliver to him diamonds to the amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>1,600,000 livres, and which diamonds he actually received.
What makes this event the more extraordinary is that the
Cardinal is known to be a man of extremely good parts, and
is in the enjoyment of the greatest honour and revenues to
which any subject in the Church can aspire.</p>

<p class='c049'>And again:</p>

<p class='c037'>Mme. de la Motte, from an apprehension that her life
is in danger, affects to have lost her senses. The jailer, upon
entering her room the day before yesterday, was some time
before he discovered her, and at length found her under her
bed, quite naked.</p>

<p class='c042'>It would, of course, take up too much space to give
all Dorset’s despatches on this subject. I mention them
chiefly because a large proportion of the diamonds
composing the original necklace are at Knole, one half
having been purchased by the Duke of Dorset after
the necklace had been split up and brought to England,
and the other half by the Duke of Sutherland. This,
at least, is the tradition; and there is some evidence to
support it, in a receipt among the Knole papers:</p>

<p class='c037'><strong>Received</strong> of his Grace the <span class='fss'>DUKE</span> of <span class='fss'>DORSET</span> nine hundred
and seventy-five pounds for a brilliant necklace.</p>

<table class='table4' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c027'>£975</td>
    <td class='c053'>For Mr. <span class='fss'>JEFFERYS</span> and self, <span class='fss'>W M JONES</span>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c049'>and this receipt is endorsed “Paid 1790,” which
tallies with the date when the necklace was sold by
De la Motte to Jefferys, a jeweller in Piccadilly. They
are beautiful diamonds, small, but very blue, and are
set at present in the shape of a tasselled diadem.</p>

<p class='c042'>Another topic which temporarily exercised the duke
while in Paris was the “very extraordinary proposal”
made to the French Government by a M. Montgolfier to</p>

<p class='c036'>construct a balloon of a certain diameter to carry sixteen
persons. The project [<em>the despatch continues</em>] is to carry on
a trade between this part and the South of France; Paris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and Marseilles are the two places named. The balloon is to
be freighted with plate glass, and the return to be made in
reams of paper. M. de Calonne has hitherto received the
proposal with great coolness, as M. Montgolfier requires an
advance of 60,000 livres Tournais. It is, however, under
contemplation, as M. Montgolfier has declared his intention
of making the offer to our government in case he does not
meet with encouragement here. It is said that the Comptroller
General rather discourages enterprises of this sort, as
any further progress in the art of conducting balloons might
tend to prejudice the revenues of the City of Paris, which
will shortly be surrounded by a wall, the cost of which is
estimated at four or five millions.</p>

<p class='c042'>The duke naturally thought M. Montgolfier’s plans
nonsensical:</p>

<p class='c037'>I should almost scruple to mention to your Lordship an
undertaking so extraordinary [<em>he says</em>] had I not heard from
exceedingly good authority that such a plan is seriously in
agitation. Great credit is given to M. Montgolfier’s superior
skill in these matters, and that gentleman’s friends are
sanguine in their expectations of his success. The weight
he proposes to carry <em>exceeds that of a waggon-load</em>!</p>

<p class='c042'>He gives some further details of what M. Montgolfier,
who “pretends to have at last discovered means
of directing the course of Balloons,” proposes to do:</p>

<p class='c037'>He has obtained the sanction of M. de Calonne for his
first experiment, which is to be made the first day of next
May, when he engages to depart from a town in Auvergne,
distant from Paris 150 miles, and to descend at or near this
City in the space of seven hours.</p>

<p class='c049'>A month later he writes:</p>

<p class='c037'>The government has at last accepted M. Montgolfier’s
proposal. 30,000 livres are to be granted to him in advance
for the experiment, and if it succeeds the whole of his
expenses will be paid without any examination of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>accounts, a pension granted to him, and every honorary
recompense bestowed on him to which he can aspire. He
pretends to have discovered the means of guiding his
machine, but it was not till after his project to England, in
case of refusal here, that it was accepted.</p>

<p class='c042'>On such topics as the diamond necklace and M.
Montgolfier and current affairs Dorset beguiled his
leisure and that of the Foreign Office. There is no
indication that he detected any signs of the trouble in
store. It is true that occasionally he writes in this
strain:</p>

<p class='c037'>Their Majesties, the Dauphin, and the rest of the Royal
family, are removed from Fontainebleau to Versailles. The
expenses attending these journeys of the Court is incredible.
The duc de Polignac told me that he had given orders for
2115 horses for this service.... Besides this, an adequate
proportion of horses are ordered for the removal of the heavy
baggage.... It is asserted that M. de Calonne will be
under the necessity of borrowing at least eight millions of
livres next year,</p>

<p class='c049'>and that after the fall of the Bastille he was moved to
write: “I really think it necessary that some public
caution be given to put those upon their guard who
may propose to visit this part of the continent.” But
beyond these occasional comments he does not seem to
have been troubled by any thoughts of the future. He
did not foresee that his friend “Mrs. B.,” to whom after
his return to England he continued to supply English
gloves, would lose upon the scaffold that little head
which had carried so gaily the butterfly or the frigate,
or that within two or three years’ time the English
newspapers would be writing: “The Duke of Dorset’s
seat at Knole is a place of rendezvous for the banished
French <em>noblesse</em> at this time resident in England,” or
that he would be entertaining there as a fugitive his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>friend Champcenetz, a young officer in the Swiss
Guards and author of a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit traité de l’amour des
femmes pour les sots</span></i>.” Dorset would no doubt have
proved a perfectly adequate ambassador in normal
times, but that vast situation with its infinite ramifications
was beyond an intellect that accepted for granted
the existing régime under which dukes were born for
pleasure and labourers were not. But with all the foresight
in the world it is difficult to see what he could
have done, or how the course of history could have
been affected, had he sent home grave warnings instead
of babbling of the diamond necklace and M. Montgolfier.</p>

<p class='c042'>There was another distraction for him in Paris:
Giannetta Baccelli, an Italian dancer. The duke seems
to have lost his head completely over her for the time
being, for he gave her his Garter to wear as a hair-ribbon,
with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE</span>”
in diamonds, brought her home to England with him,
sent her to a ball in Sevenoaks wearing the family
jewels—which provoked a great scandal in the county—and
gave her one of the towers at Knole, which to
this day remains, through the mispronunciation of the
English servants, “Shelley’s Tower.” It was for this
lady, or so the rumour ran, that he finally rejected the
faithful and unfortunate Lady Derby. There was
nothing that Dorset would not do for Baccelli. He had
her painted by Reynolds, and painted and drawn by
Gainsborough, and sculpted from the nude. He even
wrote to his friend the Duchess of Devonshire asking
her to do what she could for his protégée, “I don’t ask
you to do anything for her openly,” he wrote, “but
I hope <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que quand il s’agit de ses talents</span></i> you will commend
her. I assure you,” he adds rather pathetically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“she is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une bonne fille</span></i>, very clever, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un excellent
cœur</span></i>, and her dancing is really wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c042'>Gainsborough’s large full-length portrait of Baccelli,
originally at Knole, has been sold; but his pencil
sketch for it remains, rather faded and very delicate
of line. It is drawn in the ball-room: Baccelli stands
on a model’s throne, pointing her toe and lifting up her
skirt; Gainsborough himself stands in front of her,
a palette in his hand, so that he turns his back towards
the person looking at the drawing; the Chinese page,
in a round hat, stands by. It reconstructs with great
vividness the scene of her posing in the ball-room. The
only pity is that the artist should not have drawn in
the duke, who was surely there, looking on, and
criticizing and making suggestions. The receipt for
the big picture is at Knole, though no mention is made
of the drawing (<em>see illustration facing p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a></em>):</p>

<p class='c037'><strong>Received</strong> of his Grace the <span class='fss'>DUKE</span> of <span class='fss'>DORSET</span> one hundred
guineas in full for two ¾ portraits of his Grace, one full-length
of Mad<sup>sle</sup> Baccelli, two Landskips, and one sketch of a
beggar boy and girl.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c042'>One of the “two ¾ portraits of his Grace” mentioned
in this receipt is the one now in the ball-room, one of
the most beautiful Gainsboroughs I know—included
with five other pictures for the ludicrous sum of £105.</p>

<p class='c042'>Reynolds’ portrait of the dancer shows a mischievous
and attractive face, with slightly slanting
eyes, peeping out from behind a mask which she holds
up in her hand. The duke even went to the length of
ordering the portraits of the servants he had provided
for her, and among the collection of servants’ portraits
in Black Boy Passage are Daniel Taylor and Elinor
Law, servants of Mad<sup>me</sup> Baccelli; Mrs. Edwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>attendant on Mad<sup>me</sup> Baccelli; and Philip Louvaux,
servant to Mad<sup>me</sup> Baccelli. She evidently, with her
servants and her tower, had a regular establishment at
Knole, and many receipts bearing her signature witness
the duke’s generosity towards her: “Received 7th
April 1786 of Mr. Burlington [the agent] the sum of
fifty pounds on account of his Grace the Duke of
Dorset, Jannette Baccelli,” and so on. They had
several children, all of whom died in babyhood, except
one, alluded to in the following letter: “The duke has
a very fine boy to whom Baccelli is mother, now at
school near Knole. This, we think, is the only surviving
progeny of the alliance,” but, much as I should
like to know, I have no idea what became of this
romantically-begotten scion, or even of whether he
lived to grow up.</p>

<p class='c042'>Perhaps the “heterogenous housekeeper” of Horace
Walpole’s letter was Baccelli’s importation, for in
another place he writes disgustedly of “Knole, which
disappointed me much. But unless you know how vast
and venerable I thought I remembered it, I cannot
give you the measure of my surprise; but then there
was a trapes of a housekeeper, who, I suppose, was the
Baccelli’s dresser, and who put me out of humour....”</p>

<p class='c042'>The connection seems to have lasted for a long time,
for it is not until the end of 1789 that we come across
an old newspaper cutting announcing with curious
candour that “the Duke of Dorset and the Baccelli
have just separated, and she is said to have behaved
very well,” so that she eclipsed the records of Nancy
Parsons, of Mrs. Elizabeth Armistead, and of poor
Lady Derby. It is, I think, a not unpicturesque
incident in the story of Knole—the dancer sitting in
those stately rooms to Reynolds and Gainsborough, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>descending from her tower to walk in the garden with
the duke, attended by the Chinese boy carrying her
gloves, her fan, or her parasol. Those were the days
when the Clock Tower, oddly recalling a pagoda, was
but newly erected; when the great rose-and-gold
Chinese screen in the Poets’ Parlour was new and
brilliant in the sun; when the Coromandel chests were
new toys; and the Italian pictures and the statuary
brought back by the duke from Rome were still
pointed out as the latest acquisitions. And no doubt
then the statue of the Baccelli reposing in her lovely
nudity on her couch was not relegated to the attic,
where a subsequent and more prudish generation sent
it, but stood somewhere in the living-rooms, where it
might be seen and admired in the presence of the
smiling model. Amusement was caused too, no doubt,
among the guests of the duke and the dancer by Sir
Joshua’s portrait of the Chinese boy squatting on his
heels, a fan in his hand, and the square toes of his red
shoes protruding from beneath his robes. It was more
original to have a Chinese page than to have a black
one; everybody had a black one: “Dear Mama,”
wrote the Duchess of Devonshire to her mother,
“George Hanger has sent me a Black boy, eleven
years old and very honest, but the duke don’t like me
having a black, and yet I cannot bear the poor wretch
being ill-used; if you liked him instead of Michel
I will send him, he will be a cheap servant and you will
make a Christian of him and a good boy; if you don’t
like him they say Lady Rockingham wants one.” But
the black page at Knole, of which there had always
been one since the days of Lady Anne Clifford, and
who had always been called John Morocco regardless
of what his true name might be, had been replaced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>a Chinaman ever since the house steward had killed
the John Morocco of the moment in a fight in Black
Boy’s Passage. This particular Chinese boy whom I
have mentioned, whose real name was Hwang-a-Tung,
but whom the English servants, much as they called
Baccelli Madam Shelley, more conveniently renamed
Warnoton—fell on fortunate days when he came to
Knole, for not only was he painted by Sir Joshua, but
he was educated at the duke’s expense at the Grammar
School in Sevenoaks.</p>

</div>

<p class='c044'>The year after the parting in which the Baccelli was
reported to have behaved so well, the duke married.
His bride was an heiress, Arabella Diana Cope, who
brought the duke, according to his own statement, a
dowry of £140,000. She must have been an imposing
figure, if one may trust Hoppner’s portrait, which
shows her walking in a white muslin dress, a little dog
frisking round her feet, and tall feathers on her head;
and Wraxall, who certainly knew her, says, with the
touch of awe and even dislike perceptible between the
lines of all his accounts of her, that “her person, though
not feminine, might then be denominated handsome;
and, if her mind was not highly cultivated or refined,
she could boast of intellectual endowments that fitted
her for the active business of life.” Wraxall writes,
possibly, with a prejudiced pen, for at one time he was
employed in sorting and classifying the Knole manuscripts,
and in this matter his views clashed with those
of her Grace and her Grace’s second husband; the
business was abandoned half way through, but
Wraxall’s trace remains in the neat, ejaculatory notes
which I find on the reverse side of many of the papers—“curious!” or “not without merit!” This may
account for the subtle spitefulness of his remarks.
Nevertheless, I imagine that Knole perceived under
the duchess’ régime a considerable contrast with the
days of the merry and pleasure-loving Baccelli. The
new duchess was a severe and orderly lady, “under the
dominion of no passion except the love of money, her
taste for power and pleasure always subordinate to her
economy,” and the duke himself, perhaps under the
influence of his wife, began to turn from his extravagant
ways towards parsimony, curtailing his expenses in spite
of the enormous increase in his income, and becoming,
moreover, irascible, fretful, morbid, and quarrelsome.
The days of his patronage of opera and Parisian ballet
were over, the days when he was confident that the talk
of his ball in Paris would reach the ears of the Duchess
of Devonshire in London. His expenses at Knole were
reported to be reduced to four or five thousand a year,
yet he could not endure to hear the praise of other
houses, for Knole he considered “as possessing everything.”
It is not an attractive picture of the gay duke’s
declining years. Hoppner, who had been staying at
Knole for nine or ten days painting the three children,
described the duke as most unpleasant in his temper,
anxious and saving, humoursome and uncomfortable,
“not suffering the dinner to be all placed on the table,”
and when, playing at Casino, he lost fifteen shillings to
Hoppner he “fretted when the cards he wished
for were taken up.” The three children were brought
up with the utmost severity; they were scarcely
allowed to speak in the presence of their elders; and
little Lord Middlesex was sent out of the room in disgrace
at luncheon for asking his sister for the salt.
Yet I fancy that the real control, under a show of submission,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>was exercised by that commanding figure,
the duchess. She never betrayed any signs of exasperation,
whether the duke sent away the dinner, or
grumbled that Neckar was a man of no family, or that
Mr. Hailes, the secretary, was a man of no family
either—much to Mr. Hailes’ discomposure. This
dwelling upon family was one of his many crotchets,
and he was fond of pointing out that the Sackvilles
had never branched, but remained the only family of
that name in the Kingdom, and would draw attention
to the coincidence that Sackville Street was the longest
street in London without branch or turning. Prudent
and long-suffering, no doubt the duchess had in her
mind the advantages she intended to secure when she
should be no longer a wife and sick-nurse, but a widow.
Baccelli’s statue was in the attic, and Mr. Ozias
Humphrey, of the Royal Academy, was quite out of
favour because he went to Knole in the duke’s absence
and took possession of a room without previously
showing proper attention to the duchess. She presided
calmly, while the duke fretted and economized, and
quarrelled with his friends, and deteriorated in
intellect, and became a prey to gloom, and grew old
and sad before his time; she presided unruffled, for all
the while she rested satisfied in her knowledge of his
testamentary dispositions. He was, in fact, although
only in the fifties, already a very ill man. He was
falling rapidly into a deeper and deeper melancholy,
and there is a tradition that towards the end he could
only be soothed by the playing of two musicians in a
neighbouring room—the room now called the Music
Room, in which hang, rather ironically, Reynolds’
portrait of the Baccelli peeping out from behind her
mask, and Vigée Lebrun’s portrait of the grave, greyhaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>lady, Arabella Diana, Duchess of Dorset. He
sat in the library, his hands fumbling at the breast-pin
in his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jabot</span></i>, while the soothing strains reached him,
veiled by distance. Veiled by distance, too, the
memories of his past floated to him on the music, and
melted with the music into the solace of a confused and
wistful harmony. The past, so luminous, was not
wholly lost, since in memory it was still recoverable.
There had been the fun of the masked ball in Rome;
there had been the clandestine hours of tenderness
with Betty Hamilton; there had been Versailles;
there had been the days when he could glance down
through the window and see Baccelli flirting with Sir
Joshua on the lawn. The musicians in the neighbouring
room played on. He had been twenty-four when
Knole had come to him; he had not had to wait for
his good things until he was grown too sober to enjoy
them. It had been so easy to accept the urbanity, the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</span></i>, everyone was eager to lavish; so pleasant
to move in a world so bland, so obliging, and so polite.
No effort had been necessary; the fat quails had
dropped ready roasted into his mouth. No effort: a
smile there; a gracious word here; tossed alike with a
casual, if good-humoured, contempt. Surveying himself
in his mirror while his valet knelt to buckle the
diamond Order round his knee, flicking with a lace
pocket-handkerchief at a few grains of powder fallen
upon his coat, he had been secure in the safe conduct
of his great name and his personal charm. And if the
faint ghosts whispered round him now in the quiet
library at Knole—a fair head thrust at him upon a pike,
the reproachful eyes of Lady Derby, the stilled limbs
of those half-Italian babies that the Baccelli had borne
him—why, he could banish them: Lord Middlesex slept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>in his nursery upstairs, and the tall duchess watched,
effaced though vigilant, from a corner of the library.
But when she rose and came towards him, thinking that
he had fallen asleep in his nodding over the fire, he repulsed
her fretfully, with the gesture of an old man, and
wondered at himself in his confused and unhappy mind
for this anomalous discourtesy towards a woman.</p>

<p class='c042'>Next door to the Music Room hangs the lovely
full-length of the three children, painted by Hoppner
while on that uncomfortable visit. One is bound to
admit that their appearance bears no impress of the
grand, solemn, and gloomy household in which they
were being brought up. The little boy, rosy, flaxen-curled,
in high nankeen trousers and a soft frilly shirt,
has his arms round his baby sister, who, with bare
toes, is looking sulkily at her elder sister’s shoes; they
are out in the park; nothing could be more natural
or unconstrained. My grandfather used to show me
the baby girl, telling me that while Hoppner was
seeking for a pose for his picture a grievance arose
between the two little girls because one had shoes and
the other had not, and that on Lord Middlesex taking
his sister into his arms for consolation, Hoppner rushed
at them exclaiming that he could not improve upon
the charm of this accidental pose. I think this story
has a convincing ring about it. Certainly it was the
only anecdote which my grandfather had to tell of
any picture in the house; usually he did not know a
Hoppner from a Vandyck, a Kneller from a Gainsborough.
He said that he had the story straight from
his mother, Lady Elizabeth, the sulky baby of Hoppner’s
picture, and the young woman in fancy dress of
Beechey’s portrait in the same room.</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The only pleasant aspect of these later years of the
gay duke’s life is his friendship and constant employment
of the artists of his day. Before he fell into what
Wraxall calls his “mental alienation” he counted
Reynolds among his intimates, was a pall-bearer at his
funeral in Westminster Abbey, and accumulated so
many works of that artist at Knole, including one at
the back of which is written, “Sir Joshua Reynolds,
painted by himself and presented to his Grace the Duke
of Dorset in 1780,” that what was once the Crimson
Drawing-Room became known as the Reynolds Room;
and the Reynolds Room it is to this day. Madame
Vigée Lebrun stayed at Knole, which she found too
gloomy for her taste, the duchess warning her, the
first time they sat down to dinner, “You will find it
very dull, for we never speak at table.” Ozias
Humphrey, before he was so unfortunate as to offend
the duchess, contributed a number of canvases to the
duke’s collection:</p>

<p class='c042'>It is perhaps significant of his new economy that the

<p class='c042'>With Opie, too, he was on friendly terms, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>amongst the other receipts at Knole is one from Opie
for the portrait of Edmund Burke for £24 3<em>s.</em> There
is also a letter at Knole from Burke, who probably
knew his Grace’s weakness for his house:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c037'>I am just now honoured with your Grace’s letter, and
am extremely concerned that it is not in my power to accept
your Grace’s most obliging invitation. I have great respect
for its present possessor; and as for the place, I, who am
something of a lover of all antiquities, must be a very great
admirer of Knole. I think it the most interesting thing in
England. It is pleasant to have preserved in one place the
succession of the several tastes of ages; a pleasant habitation
for the time, a grand repository of whatever has been pleasant
at all times. This is not the sort of place which every banker,
contractor, or Nabob can create at his pleasure.... I
would not change Knole if I were the Duke of Dorset for all
the foppish structures of this age.</p>

<p class='c042'>Other receipts at Knole make it clear that the
average price for a half-length was £37, while for a
full-length by Reynolds the duke paid £300.</p>

<p class='c042'>There is also a mention in a contemporary diary that
the duke asked Hoppner for his portrait, which he
promised should be hung next to Sir Joshua’s portrait
of himself. The diary notes that Ozias Humphrey’s
<cite>Selbstbildnis</cite> is “still in the room, but has been removed
from its place next the Reynolds.” It is “still in the
room” now, a man with a delicate face and a pointed
nose, on the wall with Gainsborough’s <cite>Lord George
Sackville</cite>, Sir Joshua’s <cite>Samuel Foote</cite>, his <cite>Oliver Goldsmith</cite>,
his <cite>Peg Woffington</cite>, and his own portrait; but
the Hoppner for which the duke asked is not there,
and never was; no doubt Hoppner was not sufficiently
encouraged by the uncomfortable visit to send so
valuable an acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>At this period England lay under the fear of an
invasion by the young victorious Bonaparte, and a
scheme was set on foot for raising a corps of infantry
to be called the Knole volunteers; I recently came
across some of their accoutrements in an old locker
at Knole; they had an amateurish look. A document
bearing many blots and the signatures of all the
volunteers—or, in some cases, their mark—is also at
Knole:</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='fss'>HIS GRACE</span> <em>the</em> <span class='fss'>DUKE</span> <em>of</em> <span class='fss'>DORSET’S</span> offer of raising a Corps of

Volunteers</em>, for the purpose of preserving Order and protecting
property in the Parish and Neighbourhood of
Sevenoaks having been accepted, and George Stone, Stephen
Woodgate, and Thomas Mortimer Kelson being appointed
officers by his Majesty to command the same, they propose
the following Rules and Regulations, which they hope will
be cheerfully submitted to by all who have voluntarily come
forward to offer their services in the said Corps at this
important Crisis:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>

    half after Six o’clock to half after Eight o’clock in the Evening.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>2nd. As a regular attendance is particularly essential, it is proposed that the small Sum
    of Sixpence be paid by every person not present to answer to his Name when called over at
    the time appointed, unless it appears he is prevented by Sickness, which forfeits, should
    there be any, shall be spent by the Corps at the end of the year in any manner they shall
    think proper.

<p class='c037'><em>Finally</em>, they wish it to be clearly understood that their
Services shall not be required to extend further than the

<p class='c042'>But it is improbable that the duke had much to do
with the raising or organisation of this corps, for during
the last twenty months of his life his irascibility turned
to definite melancholia, and he remained at Knole
more or less alone with the duchess keeping a jealous
guard over him. It is impossible not to draw the
parallel between his end and that of Charles the
Restoration earl, his great-grandfather, remembering
especially the wildness and extravagance in which
both had spent their youth; but whereas Charles was
carried away to Bath at the end by that sordid woman
Ann Roche, the duke was carefully tended in his own
great house by the reserved and prudent woman he
had married, too dignified to be accused save under the
veil of polite phrases of intriguing to get the control of
his affairs into her own hands. So he sank gradually,
and in 1799, at the age of fifty-four, he died, when it
was found that he had so disposed of his lands, his
fortune, and his boroughs that Arabella Diana was
left with so great an accumulation of wealth and of
parliamentary influence as had “scarcely ever vested,
among us, in a female, and a widow.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> Knole in the Nineteenth Century</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>§ i</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c050'>The new Duke of Dorset was only five years old
when his father’s dignities descended so prematurely
on to his small yellow head, but he
had a capable mentor in the person of his mother, and
before two years had elapsed her authority was reinforced
by that of a stepfather. This was Lord Whitworth,
recently Ambassador to the Courts of Catherine
II. and Paul I. The circumstances of Lord Whitworth’s
recall had been in the least degree mysterious.
Various rumours were current; amongst others, that
he had offended the Czar in the following somewhat
ludicrous manner: the Czar having forbidden that
any empty carriage should pass before a certain part
of his palace, Lord Whitworth, uninformed of the
regulation, ordered his coach to meet him at a point
which would entail passing over the forbidden area.
The sentry held up the coach; the servants persisted
in driving on; they came to blows; and the Czar,
when the affair came to his ears, ordered Lord Whitworth’s
servants to be beaten, the horses to be beaten,
and the coach to be beaten too. Lord Whitworth, in a
fit of rage and petulance, dismissed his servants,
ordered the horses to be shot, and the coach to be
broken into pieces and thrown into the Neva.</p>

<p class='c042'>He appears to have had at least one trait in common
with the Sackvilles themselves, at any rate in early life,
for it was said of him that he was “more distinguished
during this period of his career by success in gallantries
than by any professional merits or brilliant services.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Even at the time of his marriage, when, returning from
Russia to England, he found available the wealthy and
desirable relict of his friend the late Dorset, he was
heavily entangled with a lady named Countess
Gerbetzow, whose partiality for the English Ambassador
had been such that she had placed her own fortune
at his disposal for the purpose of clothing himself and
defraying the expenses of his household. In return for
this affection and assistance Lord Whitworth promised
her marriage as soon as she could divorce her husband;
but during the course of the divorce proceedings the
Ambassador was recalled, and left for England on the
understanding that Countess Gerbetzow would follow
him there as soon as she conveniently could. Meanwhile
he made the acquaintance of the more eligible
duchess, became engaged to her, and lost no time in
marrying her. Countess Gerbetzow had, however, by
now obtained her divorce, and was travelling across
Europe on her way to England: at Leipzic she learnt
from a newspaper that Lord Whitworth in London was
engaged to the Duchess of Dorset. Indignant and outraged,
she flew post-haste to London. Too late: she
arrived only to find that the marriage had already been
celebrated. But she would not allow the matter to rest
there, and “her reclamations, which were of too delicate
and serious a nature to be despised, at length compelled
the duchess, most reluctantly, to pay her Muscovite
rival no less a sum than ten thousand pounds.”
Whether the duchess continued to think Lord Whitworth
worth the price is not recorded. If he was an
expensive husband, he was certainly from the worldly
standpoint a very successful one, and that was a standpoint
the duchess was not likely to despise. He became
successively Ambassador to the French Republic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and an earl, but “we may
nevertheless be allowed to doubt,” observes Wraxall,
who claims Lord Whitworth’s personal friendship,</p>

<p class='c037'>whether a humbler matrimonial alliance might not have been
attended with more felicity&nbsp;... united to a woman of
inferior fortune and condition&nbsp;... he would certainly have
presented an object of more rational envy and respect than
as the second husband of a duchess, elevated by her connections
to dignities and offices, subsisting on her
possessions, and who will probably ere long inter him with
an earl’s coronet on his coffin.—I return [<em>says Wraxall,
having thus dismissed the pair</em>] to Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p class='c042'>I doubt whether the little duke was allowed a very
exuberant enjoyment of his boyhood with this couple
in authority over him. Children were strictly brought
up in that generation, and it is clear that the duchess
was by nature a severe and not very sympathetic
woman. The little boy and his sisters must have been
docile and well behaved in the great house and gardens
which belonged to him in name only, but which in
practice were entirely under his mother’s control, for
her to alter the windows as she pleased, and to put
Lord Whitworth’s cognizance in the stained glass
beside the Sackville arms. I visualize—I scarcely know
why—the duchess and Lord Whitworth almost as the
jailers of the small inheritor. There is nothing to
justify such a theory; and, indeed, very little record
remains of that short life: there is his rocking-horse—an
angular, long-necked, maneless animal, which in due
course became my property, after passing through the
two intervening generations—his brief friendship with
Byron as a schoolboy, and his portrait as a tall, fair
young man in dark blue academical robes. There is very
little else to mark his passage across the stage of Knole.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>He came, late in time, of a race never remarkable for
strength of character, and the obituary notice which
described him as having possessed gentle and engaging
manners, tinctured by shyness, and of amiable temper,
probably came nearer to the truth than the generality of
such eulogies. Byron has told us nothing in the least
illuminating of his friend. He has left a long address
in verse, included in <cite>Hours of Idleness</cite>, in which he is
careful to explain that the duke was his fag at Harrow,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Whom still affection taught me to defend,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And made me less a tyrant than a friend,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Though the harsh custom of our youthful band</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Bade</em> thee <em>obey, and gave me to command</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c049'>and equally careful to remind him that they might in
later years meet in the House of Lords,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><em>Since chance has thrown us in the self-same sphere,</em></div>

      <div class='line'><em>May one day claim our suffrage for the state.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c049'>The rest of the poem is an exhortation to the duke,
whose “passive tutors, fearful to dispraise,” may</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c045'>

<p class='c049'>to be worthy of the record his ancestors have left him;
of he who “called, proud boast! the British drama forth,”
and of that other one, Charles, “The pride of princes, and
the boast of song”—to become, in fine, “Not Fortune’s
minion, but her noblest son.” One suspects, in fact, that
Byron himself viewed the errors of his ducal fag with
an indulgent eye, and the depth of the friendship, on
Byron’s part at least, is easily measured by the letters
he wrote on hearing of the duke’s death—letters whose
cynicism is perhaps atoned for by their frankness:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>I have just been—or, rather, ought to be—very much
shocked by the death of the Duke of Dorset [<em>he wrote to
Tom Moore</em>]. We were at school together, and then I was
passionately attached to him. Since, we have never met—but
once, I think, in 1805—and it would be a paltry
affectation to pretend that I had any feeling for him worth
the name. But there was a time in my life when this event
would have broken my heart; and all I can say for it now
is that—it is not worth breaking.</p>

<p class='c037'>Adieu—it is all a farce.</p>

<p class='c042'>And he alludes to it once more, a fortnight later,
again writing to Moore, to say that “the death of poor
Dorset—and the recollection of what I once felt, and
ought to have felt now, but could not,” has set him
pondering.</p>

<p class='c042'>That, then, is all which the boy could leave behind
him—that he should set Byron, for a moment, pondering.
From such slight traces—the English little boy
of the Hoppner, the old-fashioned rocking-horse, and
the portrait of the fair young man—we have to reconstruct
as best we can an entire personality. We have to
figure him running about the garden at Knole; kissing
his mother’s hand—surely never throwing his arms
about her—his grave little bow to Lord Whitworth;
the “your Grace” of his nurse’s behests; the brief
contact with the dazzling personality of Byron at
Harrow; the stir with which he cannot have failed to
anticipate the advantages of his life and his emancipation.
We have the account of him playing tennis, when
a ball hit him in the eye, and obliged him to be for ever
after “continually applying leeches and blisters and
ointments and other disagreeable remedies,” and to
be “very moderate in all exercises that heat or agitate
the frame.” We have, finally, his tragic end at the age
of twenty-one, to which additional poignancy is lent
by the fact that he had recently become engaged.</p>

<p class='c042'>He had gone to Ireland, where his stepfather was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>then Viceroy, to stay with his friend and quondam
school-fellow Lord Powerscourt. On the day after his
arrival the two young men, with Lord Powerscourt’s
brother, Mr. Wingfield, went out hunting, and after
a fruitless morning they were about to return home
when they put up a hare:</p>

<p class='c037'>The hare made for the inclosures on Kilkenny Hill. They
had gone but a short distance, when the Duke, who was an
excellent forward horseman, rode at a wall, which was in
fact a more dangerous obstacle than it appeared to be....
The Duke’s mare attempted to cover all at one spring, and
cleared the wall, but, alighting among the stones on the
other side, threw herself headlong, and, turning in the air,
came with great violence upon her rider, who had not lost
his seat; he undermost, with his back on one of the large
stones, and she crushing him with all her weight on his
chest, and struggling with all her might to recover her legs.
The mare at length disentangled herself and galloped away.
The Duke sprang upon his feet, and attempted to follow her,
but soon found himself unable to stand, and fell into the
arms of Mr. Farrel, who had run to his succour, and to
whose house he was conveyed. Lord Powerscourt, in the
utmost anxiety and alarm, rode full speed for medical
assistance, leaving his brother, Mr. Wingfield, to pay every
possible attention to the Duke. But, unfortunately, the
injury was too severe to be counteracted by human skill;
life was extinct before any surgeon arrived. Such was the
melancholy catastrophe that caused the untimely death of
this young nobleman. He had been of age only three months,
and had not taken his seat in the House of Lords [1815].</p>

<p class='c042'>The author of this obituary notice was at great pains
to clear the young man of any charge of “unseasonable
levity”:</p>

<p class='c037'>It has been said [<em>he observes</em>] that the Duke, in his dying
moments, made use of the expression “I am off.” He did
so; but not, as has been very erroneously supposed, by way
of heroic bravado, or in a temper of unseasonable levity; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>simply to signify to his attendants, who, in pulling off his
boots, had drawn him too forward on the mattress, and
jogged one of the chairs out of its place, that he was <em>slipping
off</em>, and wanted their aid to help him up into his former
position. He was the last person in the world to be guilty
of anything like levity upon any solemn occasion, much
less in his dying moments. The fact was, when he used
the expression “I am off” he had become very faint and
weak, and was glad to save himself the trouble of further
utterance....</p>

<p class='c037'>Now suppose a stranger to the real character of this
excellent youth to have heard no more of him than what he
would be most likely to hear of one whose constitutional
modesty concealed his virtues, namely, that he was very fond
of cricket, that he hurt his eye with a tennis-ball, that he
lost his life hunting, that his last words were “I am off”;
would not a person possessed of this information, and no
more, naturally conclude that the Duke was a young man
of trivial mind, addicted to idle games and field sports, and
apt to make light of serious things? How false a notion
would such a person form of the late Duke of Dorset! As
to the four circumstances above alluded to, if he was fond of
cricket, it was in the evening generally that he played. When
he hurt his eye [it was on the 7th of December] he had been
at his books all the morning, and went between dinner and
dusk to take one set at tennis. When he lost his life hunting,
he had not hunted ten times the whole season. And what
have been represented as his last words were not his last
words; and, even if they were, they had no other meaning
than “Pray prevent a helpless man from slipping down out
of his place.” That he was not a mere sportsman, a mere
idler, or a mere trifler, witness the wet eyes that streamed at
every window in the streets of Dublin as his hearse was
passing by; witness the train of carriages that composed his
funeral procession; witness the throng of Nobility and
Gentlemen that attended his remains to the sea-shore;
witness the families he had visited in Ireland; witness the
reception of his corpse in England; witness the amazing
concourse of friends, tenantry, and neighbours, that came
to hear the last rites performed, and to see him deposited in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the tomb; witness the more endeared set of persons who
still mean to hover round the vault where he is laid!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ ii</h3>

<p class='c044'>It now became apparent how exceedingly wise had
been the precautionary measures taken by the duchess
in regard to her husband’s will. A distant cousin, the
son of Lord George, succeeded to the title as fifth and
last duke—this part of the succession was beyond the
reach of her control—but under the terms of the will
Knole became her property for life, and she received in
addition, on the death of her son, an increase in her
income of nine thousand a year. She must certainly
have been one of the richest women in England. Lord
Whitworth, meanwhile (till 1817), continued as Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and as the originals of the
following letters written to him by Sir Robert Peel,
with enclosures in Peel’s handwriting, are at Knole,
I think it not wholly irrelevant to print them here, with
a few other notes, in view of their interest as being
written immediately after the battle of Waterloo, and
having, so far as I know, never before been published.</p>

with which the Cuirassiers fought. When they found
they could make no impression on the solid mass of infantry—they
halted in front and deliberately charged their pistols
and shot at individuals of course without a chance of surviving.
Lord Bathurst showed me a letter which he had
received from Apsley. He says that Bonaparte had a
scaffolding erected out of cannon shot from the top of which
he saw the field of battle and the progress of the fight. When
he found that success was almost hopeless he put himself at
the head of the Imperial Guard—and charged in person.
They were met by the first foot guards who overthrew them
completely. The conduct of all the British infantry was
beyond praise—Lord Wellington had about sixty-five
thousand men in the field. Castlereagh told me that he
thought Bonaparte must have lost the fourth of his army.
This is of course mere conjecture.</p>

<p class='c037'>Of the Regiments of Cavalry which distinguished themselves
the Life Guards, the 10th, and the 18th are particularly
mentioned. The field of battle after the action presented
a most extraordinary sight. The panic of the French
army after their failure—and the fruitlessness of the
desperate courage they had shewn—was very great when the
attack on our part commenced. They threw away their arms—knapsacks,
etc., etc., in the greatest confusion. The
Prussians gave no quarter in the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c037'>The Duke and Blucher met for a moment after the action—in
the village of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La heureuse Alliance</span></i> [sic].</p>

<p class='c037'>The Belgian Cavalry and some of the British did not much
distinguish themselves. I hear that the 7th, Lord Uxbridge’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>own regiment, have not added much to their reputation—but
do not quote me for this piece of intelligence. General
Picton was shot through the head. He behaved with the
greatest possible gallantry.</p>

<p class='c037'>Schartzenburg [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>] is supposed to have crossed the Rhine
with an immense force—perhaps 200,000 men on or about
the 20th. I should rather say it was expected that he would
cross about that time. There is no account from Paris—or
from the French army.</p>

<p class='c037'>I have sent you a strange mixture of detached and unconnected
particulars. I heard them one by one—in such a
hurry—and am now obliged to write to you in such a hurry
that I may not detain the express that I cannot reduce them
into any shape.</p>

<p class='c037'>The consequence of our success must infallibly lead to a
reduction of our regular force in Ireland—forthwith I apprehend.
The Duke entreats in the strongest manner that
reinforcements of infantry may be sent to him.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c054'>As I owe my trip to Paris in great measure to the
kindness and readiness with which you dispensed
with my services in Ireland—it is but just that I
should give you some account of my proceedings—Croker,
Fitzgerald and myself left Town on Saturday Morning last
[8th] arrived at Dover that night. I was a little disappointed
to hear that the Tricolor Flag was flying at Calais—However
we were determined, perhaps rather rashly—to make
an attempt to land, and sailed the next morning in an
armed schooner—putting the guns below and hoisting a
flag of truce when we got into Calais roads. The Governor
however was inexorable—and positively refused us permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>to land. We heard that the white flag was flying
at Dunkirk and at Boulogne and the wind favoured for the
latter—we made for it. As we passed Vimereux and
Ambleteuse we saw the white flag flying there and indeed
at every intervening village between Calais and Boulogne.
It was late in the evening when we arrived off Boulogne—we
could discern that there was a flag hoisted, and on standing
in close into the harbour we found it was the Tricolor.</p>

<p class='c037'>Fitzgerald and I were so sick and heartily tired of our
voyage, that we resisted most strenuously Croker’s proposition
to make for Dieppe—we wrote a very civil note to
the Commandant—hoisted our flag of Truce and despatched
a messenger. He was detained about three hours—he said
that our arrival in the roads had caused great alarm in the
garrison—that he had been placed under arrest on his
landing—had been taken to the Commandant who was holding
a sort of Council of war—that the flag of truce was mistaken
for the white flag—particularly as the Schooner was
armed—and unfortunately for us three or four English
Brigs were in the offing.</p>

<p class='c037'>However he brought with him a civil answer from the
Commandant informing us that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une mesure de sureté
militaire l’occupoit à le moment</span>,” but when he was at
leisure he would send a boat for us.</p>

<p class='c037'>We were half afraid to trust ourselves to him, particularly
as he told our envoy that he could not recognize a flag of
truce in an armed vessel, but the apprehension of a sail to
Dieppe with a contrary wind overcame the apprehension of
a day or two’s confinement at Boulogne. The boat arrived—and
we landed at Boulogne about 3 o’clock on Monday
morning. The Commandant was civil to us but did not
conceal from us that he was a furious Bonapartist. He said
he had no soldiers—if he had 30 that white flag in the next
village should not be hoisted—or there should be a massacre
if it was. We proceeded on our journey about 7 o’clock
on the morning of Monday—nothing could exceed the
apparent devotion of all the inhabitants of the country
through which we passed to the cause of Louis—the white
flag was hanging from every window. Vive le Roi was in
every mouth. We met with no interruption until we arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>at Montreuil—where there was a strong garrison—the
Commandant like the officers—determined Bonapartists.
We had nothing but Castlereagh’s passport except La
Chatre’s which was worse than nothing, but the Commandant
allowed us after some parley to proceed. The
presence of the military was hardly sufficient to keep down
the popular feeling in favour of the King—among the
inhabitants it was universal here as every where else, there
was not a single exception. At Abbeville we were again
stopped. Here there was a very strong garrison—2000
men. Party spirit was running very high. The inhabitants
were armed—the military seemed disposed to resist the
order which they expected to receive on the day of our
arrival, to lay down their arms and leave the town.</p>

<p class='c037'>Every precaution was taken as if the town was besieged.
There were soldiers at every drawbridge. The Commandant
however allowed us to proceed—and we arrived safely at
Paris on the evening of Tuesday.</p>

<p class='c037'><em>Sunday, 16th.</em></p>

<p class='c037'>Paris is surrounded by the troops of the allies and nothing
can be more interesting than the present situation of it. The
streets are crowded with officers and soldiers of all nations.
Cossacks—Russians—Prussians, Austrians, Hungarians,
etc. The English are great favourites. The Prussians held
in the greatest detestation. If they had entered Paris alone—or
if the Crowned Heads had delayed their entry—they, the
Prussians would probably have pillaged Paris. They have
taken some pictures from the Louvre—a very few, however,
and none to which they had not some claim. They have
demanded the payment of one hundred millions of francs
from the city and at this moment—there are Prussian
guards in the houses of Perigaux and some of the other
principal bankers who are held as a sort of hostage—for the
payment of the contribution.</p>

<p class='c037'>We drove to-day to the Depot d’Artillerie, and were told
by the sentry—one of the national guards, that we were
welcome to see the salon—but that the Prussians had removed
everything which it contained—the sword of Joan
of Arc—the knife of Ravaillac—Turenne’s sword. I am
sorry for this—not on account of the mortification which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>will inflict on French vanity—but because I fear the return
of the King will be less popular—than it would have been
if he could have preserved entire at least those national
monuments and relics which are exclusively French.</p>

<p class='c037'>We paid a visit to Denon the other day. He had some
Prussians quartered upon him, and was very loud in his
exclamations against <em>ce</em> [sic] <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête féroce</span></i> as he called Blucher.
He expressed his sentiments very freely on political subjects—said
the King was not destined to govern France in times
like these—and predicted a short duration to his dynasty.
He spoke in terms of great and apparently sincere affection
towards Bonaparte—he was the last person who saw him
before he quitted Paris. Denon observed that he had
committed a great error after the battle of Waterloo in
quitting the army—that he had by that step lost its confidence—that
he ought either to have remained with it—or
to have returned to it immediately. If he had summoned
the two chambers, informed them without reserve of his
disasters and concluded by stating that his travelling
carriage was at the door and that he was going to resume
the command of the army, that even still he need not have
despaired of ultimate success.</p>

<p class='c037'>At the Tuileries after mass there was a great collection
of Marshals—Peers of France—and other rogues of the
higher order. We saw Marmont—Macdonald—Masséna—St.
Cyr—Dupont, etc., and almost all the General officers
of the French army who are in Paris—and did not take a
decided part against the King. The garden of the Tuileries
was absolutely full of people, and nothing can exceed or
describe the enthusiasm of the women and children in
favour of the King. If shouts—and applause and Vive le
Roi—and white handkerchiefs could contribute to his
strength—his throne would be established on solid foundations,
but I do not see that men—fighting men—partake so
much of the general joy—I confess I think the King has
been ill advised in making Fouché his chief confidant and
minister. It seems to me that it must preclude him from
punishing treason in others—if he rewards so notorious a
traitor as Fouché so highly. Fouché betrayed the King—then
he betrayed Bonaparte—then he betrayed the Provisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Government of which he was the head and now he is
minister. In fact he betrayed the Provisional Government
deliberately—and on condition that he should be the King’s
adviser. The virulence of French traitors—owing to the
impunity of Treason—is beyond conception. Grouchy has
written a letter to the Emperor of Russia requesting him
to intercede in his favour with the King—and to procure for
him permission to retain his rank as Marshal in the French
army or, if that cannot be granted, that the Emperor will
allow him to enter the Russian army retaining his present
rank. The Emperor’s answer was not amiss. He had
nothing to say to his first Proposition—and with respect to
his second—it was an indispensable qualification in a Russian
officer that he should be a man of honour.</p>

<p class='c037'>That on the 20th he left Paris, and notwithstanding there
were firing of guns and other marks of rejoicing, there was a

gives a long account of what is called the battle of Marennart,
stating that the British were 90,000 men and the French not
so many, that until four in the Evening the French had completely
won the battle, but that about that hour the English
Cavalry had attacked the Cuirassiers and routed them, that
the young guards coming to their assistance got entangled
in their confusion, and the old guard was likewise
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrainée</span></i>.” At this moment some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Malveillant</span></i> in the army
cried “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauve qui peut</span>” and a general flight commenced;
the whole left wing of the army <em>dispersed</em>: He lost all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>cannon caissons etc. Buonaparte had ordered the wreck of
his army to be collected near Phillipville, and he had issued
directions calling on the Northern provinces to rise in mass.
This, says the <cite>Moniteur</cite>, ended a battle so glorious yet so
fatal to the French arms. Buonaparte has arrived in Paris
on the morning of the 21st. The Council of Ministers and
the two chambers had been placed in a state of permanency
and it was declared high treason to vote an adjournment.</p>

<p class='c037'>What do you think of the total defeat of Bonaparte by the
British Army?</p>

<p class='c037'>Never was there in the annals of the World so desperate
or so hard fought an action, or such a defeat. It was really
the battle of the Giants.</p>

<p class='c037'>My heart is broken by the terrible loss I have sustained

and I shall not be satisfied with this Battle however glorious,

</div>

<p class='c037'>On the 16th to the very great astonishment of everyone
the French attacked us or rather the Prussians, Lord
Wellington came up with a very few Troops including the
7 Divisions and succeeded in stopping them, the next day
was passed in partial Cavalry actions and yesterday was
fought the severest battle that I believe ever has been known,
the disproportion was immense so much so that altho’ we
constantly repulsed them yet had not the Prussians come up
at 7 (altho’ in fact they might have been up long before) we
perhaps might ultimately have been annihilated. Trotter and
I was on the field at the beginning and I count it as the best
day of my life—I was there also to-day—the French have
abandoned everything—In point of Artillery it is a second
Vittoria.</p>

<p class='c037'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Our loss is so great that our Army will not I fear be in a
state to act efficiently—but as we have done the material
thing, the Allies may do the rest—the French Cavalry which
was very fine suffered beyond expression—For a mile the
road is actually strewed with Cuirasses—when I say this,
I do not exaggerate. The Prussians are pursuing as fast as
they can and with a large body of Troops. There will not
be a stop by possibility till we get over the Frontier, after that
time I dare not prophesy, but I do not think they will like
to attack us again.</p>

<p class='c037'>The Action was fought in front of <em>Waterloo</em> where two
Roads separate—the one going to Nivelle, the other to
Genappe—the position which was a very beautiful one was
in front of the junction of the two roads. [<em>unsigned.</em>]</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c037'>The great action of yesterday was the severest contest
either Frenchmen or Englishmen ever witnessed—it was
the most obstinate struggle of two brave and rival Nations
each firm in its cause—The gallantry of the French could only
be exceeded by the resolution and intrepidity of John Bull.
It raged from 11 till 9 and was once nearly lost. The Duke
seconded by his Troops repaired every momentary disaster.</p>

<p class='c037'>Buonaparte placed himself at the head of his guards and
led them on. The 1st Guards defeated them and put them to
the rout and then the dismay became general—The Guards
and generally the Infantry were the mainstay of the Action.
Our Brigade had the defence of a Post which if lost, lost all.
Our Light Company under Colonel Macdonnell were there,
the Coldstreams then went down and we held it to the last,
tho’ the Houses were in Flames. The loss has been immense—The
French are totally defeated.</p>

<p class='c037'>There never was a more severe Battle than that of the
18th. I enclose a little Sketch of it. The dotted Line from
Braine la Leud to above La Haye is the brow of the Hills
occupied by the Duke of Wellington. The Troops had
bivouaced just in the rear. The other dotted line near La
Belle Alliance marks the brow of the Hills from where the
French attack was made. There are two small Hedges in
the Rear of this one. The Attack on Hougomont was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>severe from a little before 12 to half past one. Bonaparte
then moved a strong Force (continuing however his first
Attack for several hours) to attack the left of the Centre
where Picton and Ponsonby were killed. He drove our
people from the Hedges a short distance but they soon
returned and drove him considerably beyond those Hedges.
In the Evening he collected a very great force near La Haye
Sainte and attacked the Right of the Centre. This was done
repeatedly by Infantry and Cavalry but though they frequently
got through the Line they could never drive them
from their position. The British Artillery was a little in
front. The Duke several times left the Guns taking away the
Horses and Ammunition, but his Fire was too heavy for the
Enemy to bring up Horses to take them off and he as often
regained them. At about 7 o’clock the French were heartily
sick of it and retired rapidly. The Duke immediately
changed his Defensive operations to that of Attack and at the
same time Bulow brought up about 30,000 fresh Troops on
the right flank of the Enemy near the Village of La Haye.
Blucher was also near at hand.</p>

<p class='c037'>The Rout at this time was complete. The Pursuit was
rapid and I really believe that the following morning the
French Army had not 50 Guns out of 300 and no Baggage
of any sort.</p>

<p class='c037'>The latter part of this Account I take from others and
from seeing the Field of Battle two days afterwards. The
first and second attacks I was present at.</p>

<p class='c037'>The Returns are arrived of Killed and Wounded. The
British and Hanoverians lost on the 16th, 17th and 18th
845 Officers and 13,000 Men. The French lost much more.
The Method in which the Duke received the united Charges
of Cavalry and attacks of Infantry is not common. He formed
two Regiments in Squares and united them by a Regt. in
Line four deep making a Sort of Curtain between two
Bastions. [<em>unsigned.</em>]</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ iii</h3>

<p class='c044'>After Lord Whitworth’s term of office had come to
an end he and the duchess returned to live at Knole,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and to make such improvements there as were agreeable
to the taste of the early nineteenth century. Such
were the Gothic windows of the Orangery, which
replaced the Tudor ones and were inscribed with the
date 1823, and further changes were projected, such
as a design which was to sweep away the symmetry of
the lawns on the garden front and bring a curving path
up to the house. This scheme, however, was never
carried out. The bowling-green still rises, square and
formal, backed by the two great tulip trees and the
more distant woods of the park. The long perspective
of the herbaceous borders was left undisturbed. The
apple-trees in the little square orchards, that bear their
blossom and their fruit from year to year with such countrified
simplicity in the heart of all that magnificence,
were not uprooted. Consequently the garden, save for
one small section where the paths curve in meaningless
scollops among the rhododendrons, remains to-day
very much as Anne Clifford knew it. It has, of course,
matured. The white rose which was planted under
James I’s room has climbed until it now reaches beyond
his windows on the first floor; the great lime has drooped
its branches until they have layered themselves in the
ground of their own accord and grown up again with
fresh roots into three complete circles all sprung from
the parent tree, a cloister of limes, which in summer
murmurs like one enormous bee-hive; the magnolia outside
the Poets’ Parlour has grown nearly to the roof, and
bears its mass of flame-shaped blossoms like a giant candelabrum;
the beech hedge is twenty feet high; four
centuries have winnowed the faultless turf. In spring the
wisteria drips its fountains over the top of the wall into
the park. The soil is rich and deep and old. The garden
has been a garden for four hundred years.</p>

<p class='c042'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>And here, save for a few very brief notes to bring
the history of the house down to the present day, these
sketches must cease. The duchess Arabella Diana
dying in 1825, her estate devolved upon her two
daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. Elizabeth, my great-grandmother,
who married John West, Lord de la
Warr, and who died in 1870, left Buckhurst to her
elder sons and Knole to her younger sons, one of
whom was my grandfather. He was, as I remember
him, a queer and silent old man. He knew nothing
whatever about the works of art in the house; he spent
hours gazing at the flowers, followed about the garden
by two grave demoiselle cranes; he turned his back on
all visitors, but sized them up after they had gone in
one shrewd and sarcastic phrase; he bore a really
remarkable resemblance to the portraits of the old
Lord Treasurer, and he seemed to me, with his
taciturnity and the never-mentioned background of
his own not unromantic past, to stand conformably at
the end of the long line of his ancestors. He and I, who
so often shared the house alone between us, were companions
in a shy and undemonstrative way. Although
he had nothing to say to his unfortunate guests, he
could understand a child. He told me that there were
underground caves in the Wilderness, and I believed
him to the extent of digging pits among the laurels in
the hope of chancing upon the entrance; he made over
a tall tree to me for my own, and I mounted a wooden
cannon among its branches to keep away intruders.
When I was away, which was seldom, he would write
me harlequin letters in different coloured chalks. When
I was at home he would put after dinner a plate of fruit
for my breakfast into a drawer of his writing-table
labelled with my name, and this he never once failed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to do, even though there might have been thirty people
to dinner in the Great Hall, who watched, no doubt
with great surprise, the old man who had been so rude
to his neighbours at dinner going unconcernedly
round with a plate, picking out the reddest cherries,
the bluest grapes, and the ripest peach.</p>

<p class='c042'>When we were at Knole alone together I used to go
down to his sitting-room in the evening to play
draughts with him—and never knew whether I played
to please him, or he played to please me—and sometimes,
very rarely, he told me stories of when he was a
small boy, and played with the rocking-horse, and of
the journeys by coach with his father and mother from
Buckhurst to Knole or from Knole to London; of
their taking the silver with them under the seat; of
their having outriders with pistols; and of his father
and mother never addressing each other, in their
children’s presence, as anything but “my Lord” and
“my Lady.” I clasped my knees and stared at him
when he told me these stories of an age which already
seemed so remote, and his pale blue eyes gazed away
into the past, and suddenly his shyness would return
to him and the clock in the corner would begin to
wheeze in preparation to striking the hour, and he
would say that it was time for me to go to bed. But
although our understanding of one another was, I am
sure, so excellent, our rare conversations remained
always on similar fantastic subjects, nor ever approached
the intimate or the personal.</p>

<p class='c042'>Then he fell ill and died when he was over eighty,
and became a name like the others, and his portrait
took its place among the rest, with a label recording
the dates of his birth and death.</p>

philology, realize the existence of that large section of our
language in use among the vagabond classes. Cant and
slang, to most people’s minds, are synonymous, but this is
an error of belief: slang creeps from many sources into the
river of language, and so mingles with it that in course of
time many use it without knowing that they do so; cant, on
the other hand, remains definite and obscure of origin. Slang
is loose, expressive, and metaphorical; cant is tight and
correct: it has even a literature of its own, broad and racy,
incomprehensible to the ordinary reader without the help of
a glossary. Its words, for the most part, bear no resemblance
to English words; unlike slang, they are not words adapted,
for the sake of vividness, to a use for which they were not
originally intended, but are applied strictly to their peculiar
meaning.</p>

<p class='c042'>Although the origin of cant as a separate jargon or
language is obscure—it does not appear in England till the
second half of the sixteenth century—the origin of certain
of its words may be traced. Of those included in the
vocabulary on page <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>, for example, <em>ken</em>, for house, comes
from <em>khan</em> (gipsy and Oriental); <em>fogus</em>, for tobacco, comes
from <em>fogo</em>, an old word for stench; <em>maund</em>, or <em>maunder</em>, to
beg, does not derive, as might be thought, from <em>maung</em>, to
beg, a gipsy word taken from the Hindu, but from the
Anglo-Saxon <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mand</span></i>, a basket; <i><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bouse</span></i>, to drink (which, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>course, has given us booze, with the same meaning, and
which in the fourteenth century was perfectly good English),
comes from the Dutch <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">buyzen</span></i>, to tipple. <em>Abram</em>, naked, is
found as <i><span lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">abrannoi</span></i>, with the same meaning, in Hungarian
gipsy; <em>cassan</em>, cheese, is <em>cas</em> in English gipsy; <em>dimber</em> survives
for “pretty” in Worcestershire. <em>Cheat</em> appears
frequently in cant as a common affix.</p>

<p class='c042'>As for <em>autem mort</em>, I find it in an early authority thus defined:
“These <em>autem morts</em> be married women, as there be
but a few. For <em>autem</em> in their language is a church, so she is
a wife married at the church, and they be as chaste as a cow
I have, that goeth to bull every moon, with what bull she
careth not.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
